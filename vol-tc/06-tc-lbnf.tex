\chapter{Interfaces with LBNF}
\label{vl:tc-lbnf}

[Farshid/Terri]

In order to manage interfaces within the detector and between the
detector and facilities, an overall integration mechanism has been
developed which consist of integration nodes. Each node is integrated
and managed by a specific group. The interfaces between the nodes are
managed by the \dword{tc} engineering team.


Fig~\ref{fig:integration_nodes}  shows the interfaces between the detector and facilities.

Within the cavern items provided by LBNF are represented on the left
and the items provided by DUNE are represented on the right. In
addition, \dword{tc} engineering team is also responsible for the
integration of the DAQ room in the Central Utility Cavern and surface
control and network room. Interfaces with LBNF are managed at the
boundaries of each integration node.

%...Method for determining and controlling interfaces with LBNF including conventional facilities

%\section{Integration Drawings}

%...This section shows all interfaces. Many will be needed with
%dimensions and explanation. It will include all the interfaces between
%detector and LBNF supplied items: e.g. DSS to CS, rack placement,
%grounding, cable trays, cooling interfaces, power interfaces, DAQ
%room, above ground control room and network etc...
