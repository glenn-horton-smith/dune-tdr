\section{Organization of Interfaces}
\label{sec:inter-org-interf}
To manage interfaces within the detector and between the
detector and facilities, an overall integration mechanism has been
developed consisting of integration nodes. Each node is integrated
and managed by a specific group. The interfaces between the nodes are
managed by the \dword{tc} engineering team.

Figure~\ref{fig:integration_nodes} shows the interfaces between the
detector and facilities.

In the figure, within the cavern, items provided by \dword{lbnf} are
on the left and the items provided by \dword{dune} are on the right. In addition, the \dword{tc} engineering team integrates the \dword{daq} room in the central utility
cavern and surface control and network rooms. Interfaces with \dword{lbnf} are
managed at the boundaries of each integration node. As an example, the
interface between \dword{lbnf} and \dword{dune} for the underground \dword{daq} and control
rooms are power, cooling water, data fibers, and cable penetrations at the
room boundaries. Implementing power, cooling water, data, and
signal cables as well as integrating the racks are the responsibilities of \dword{dune}.


The integration nodes comprise the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Detector:} All \dword{tpc} elements within \dword{lar} are the responsibility of all consortia involved in
  this integration task, which is mostly mechanical. Consortia
  engineering teams work directly with the \dword{tc} engineering team.
  Interface with \dword{dss} \fixme{I have changed this to the code in the glossary, but it is possible that you meant detector safety system, which appeared in an earlier section.} through hangers. Examples of interfaces within
  this node are \dword{fc} connections to both \dwords{cpa} and \dwords{apa}, \dword{ce}, and
  \dword{pd} cable routing within the cryostat and location of calibration and
  cryogenic instrumentation. \fixme{Either all of each item should be complete sentences (followed by periods) or all should be phrases separated by semicolons and followed by a period at the end of the item itself. This should apply to everything in this bulleted list.}
\item {\bf \dword{dss}:} All detector support elements,
  cable trays, and feedthroughs.
\item {\bf Detector Electronics:} All racks, cooling, power, cable
  trays, and cable distribution on top of cryostats, rack protection
  (smoke detectors, hardware power trip); rack build (how to best load electrical hardware into the racks); interface to
  building safety systems. \fixme{I changed this to a list that is not in complete sentences, with semicolons between the phrases  and a period at the end. All the bulleted items should either be like this or in complete sentences.}
\item {\bf \dword{daq} and Electronics:} Electronics on top of cryostat and
  the \dword{cuc} \dword{daq} room and surface rooms; fiber optic distribution from
  the surface to the \dword{cuc} \dword{daq} room; fiber optic distribution from the
  detectors to the \dword{cuc} \dword{daq} room; layout and cooling of the \dword{cuc} \dword{daq}
  room. \fixme{Having those two abbreviations together may end up confusing the reader. It doesn't look good.}

\section{Interfaces with \dword{lbnf}}
\label{sec:inter-lbnf-interf}
The following figures and explanations show the
integration of the detector modules within the cavern. The interface
boundaries are not specifically pointed out in each figure, but they
follow the scheme as represented in
Figure~\ref{fig:integration_nodes}.

Figure~\ref{fig:detector_cavern} shows one detector module in the
cavern. In this figure, the cryogenics equipment and racks on top of
the detector are visible. The \dword{lar} recirculation pumps can also be seen
on the lower level.

Figure~\ref{fig:detector_ew_elevation} shows the east to west elevation view of the
detector in the cavern. The services from the
\dword{cuc} enter the cavern through a passage visible on the left.

Figure~\ref{fig:detector_ns_elevation} shows the north to south elevation view of the
detector in the cavern. The services entering
from the \dword{cuc} are visible on the right.

Figure~\ref{fig:detector_mezzanines} shows the elevation view of the
top of cryostat showing mezzanines, cryogenic equipment, and electronic
racks.

\end{dunefigure}
The cryogenics are installed on a mezzanine supported from
the cavern roof and cavern wall. Cryogenic distribution lines are
routed under the mezzanine. Local control rooms for the
cryogenic equipment are on the mezzanine.

Detector electronics are installed in short racks close to
feedthroughs and in taller racks installed on a separate
electronics gallery shown on the left. This will allow easy access
for maintenance and reduce complexity on top of the detector.
