\section{Schedule}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-controls}

A series of tiered milestones have been developed for the \dword{dune}
project. The spokespersons and host laboratory director are
responsible for the tier 0 milestones. Three tier 0 milestones have
been defined and the dates set:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Start main cavern excavation \hspace{2.58in} 20xx
\item Start \dword{detmodule}~1 installation \hspace{2.1in} 20xx
\item Start operations of \dwords{detmodule} \#1--2 with beam \hspace{0.8in} 20xx
\end{enumerate}
These dates will be revisited this spring before the \dword{tdr} is reviewed. The
\dword{tcoord} and \dword{lbnf} project manager hold the Tier 1
milestones; these milestones will be defined in advance of the
\dword{tdr} review. The consortia themselves hold the Tier 2
milestones.

Table~\ref{tab:DUNE_schedule} provides a high level version of the
\dword{dune} milestones from the \dword{ims}.

To monitor progress, \Dword{tc} will maintain the \dword{ims} that
links all consortium schedules and contains milestones for each
consortia.  The schedules will go under change control after each
consortium agrees to the milestone dates and the \dword{tdr} is
approved.  In addition to the overall \dword{ims} for construction and
installation, a schedule of key consortia activities has been
developed during 2018 and 2019.

To ensure that the \dword{dune} detector remains on schedule,
\dword{tc} will monitor schedule status from each consortium and organize
reviews of schedules and risks as appropriate.  As schedule problems
arise, \dword{tc} will work with affected consortium to resolve the
problems. If problems cannot be solved, the \dword{tc} will take the issue to the
\dword{tb} and \dword{exb}.

A monthly report with input from all consortia will be published by
\dword{tc}. This will include updates on consortium and \dword{tc}
technical progress against the \dword{ims}.

\section{Risks}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-risks}

\fixme{new standard risks table for autogenerating latex as of 3/25. I will send email. Anne}

\dword{dune} has implemented a risk registry in DocDB-6443. This
document includes tabs for consortia risks and \dword{tc} risks. It
includes a summary tab for the most significant overall \dword{dune}
risks. Tables~\ref{fig:dune_risks1} and~\ref{fig:dune_risks2} show the
overall \dword{dune} risks. This registry is updated approximately
every year. The last update was in early 2018 before ProtoDUNE was completed and the next update is
planned for spring 2019. In the next update, several risks associated
with ProtoDUNE will be retired.
\begin{dunefigure}[\dword{dune} overall risk register]{fig:dune_risks1}
  {First page of \dword{dune} overall risk register.}
  \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{DUNE_Risks_v4b1}

\begin{dunefigure}[\dword{dune} overall risk register]{fig:dune_risks2}
  {Second page of \dword{dune} overall risk register.}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{DUNE_Risks_v4b2}
\end{dunefigure}
\dword{lbnf} and \dword{dune}-US would like \dword{dune} to update and
expand this risk register to allow a Monte Carlo analysis of cost and
schedule risks to the \dword{us} project resulting from international
\dword{dune} risks. This request is under consideration.

One update to the risk registry has been for \dword{tc}, in which some
risks  associated with  DUNE  integration and  installation have  been
added. Table~\ref{fig:tc_risks} summarizes the \dword{tc} risks.
\begin{dunefigure}[\dword{tc} risks]{fig:tc_risks}
  {\dword{tc} risk register.}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{TC_Risks_v4b}
\end{dunefigure}

The next update of the risk register will separate the current overall
risk level into separate quantified probability and impact.

Successfully operating \dword{protodune} retires many
potential risks in \dword{dune} itself. This includes most risks associated with the
technical design, production processes, \dword{qa}, integration
and installation. Residual risks remain relating to design and
production modifications associated with scaling to \dword{dune}, mitigations
to known installation and performance issues in \dword{protodune}, underground
installation at \surf and organizational growth.

The highest technical risks include development of a system to
deliver \SI{600}{kV} to the \dual cathode; general delivery of the
required \dword{hv}; cathode and \dword{fc} discharge to the cryostat
membrane; noise levels, particularly for the \dword{ce}; %cold TPC electronics,
number of dead channels; lifetime of components surpassing \dunelifetime{}; %20 years,
\dword{qc} of all components; verification of improved \dword{lem}
performance; verification of new cold  \dword{adc} and  \dword{coldata} performance;
argon purity; electron drift lifetime; \phel light yield;
incomplete calibration plan; and incomplete connection of design to
physics. Other major risks include insufficient funding, optimistic
production schedules, incomplete plans for integration, testing and installation.

Key risks for \dword{tc} to manage include the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Consortia leave too much scope unaccounted for and too much falls
  to  the \dword{comfund}.
\item Insufficient organizational systems are put into place to
  ensure that this complex international mega-science project,
  including \dword{tc}, \fnal as host laboratory, \surf, DOE, and all international
  partners continue to work together successfully to ensure
  appropriate processes and services are provided for the success of
  the project.
\item Inability of \dword{tc} to obtain sufficient personnel resources to
  ensure that \dword{tc} can oversee and coordinate all project tasks.  While the \dword{us}, 
  as host country, has a special responsibility to \dword{tc}, personnel resources should
  be directed to \dword{tc} from each collaborating country. 
\end{enumerate}

The consortia have provided preliminary versions of risk analyses that
have been collected on the \dword{tc} webpage (DocDB-6443). These have
been developed into an overall risk register that will be monitored
and maintained by \dword{tc} in coordination with the consortia.  The
next update of the risk register is planned for spring 2019, in
advance of the final \dword{tdr} submission.

\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-requirements}

The scientific goals of \dword{dune} as described in \dword{dune}
\dword{tdr} Volume~\volnumberexec:~\voltitleexec include
\begin{itemize}
\item a comprehensive program of neutrino oscillation measurements
  including the search for CP violation
\item measurement of $\nu_{e}$ flux from a core-collapse supernova within our
  galaxy should one occur during \dword{dune} operations
\item searching for baryon number violation
\end{itemize}
These goals motivate a number of key detector requirements: drift
field, electron lifetime, system noise, photon detector light yield
and time resolution. The \dword{exb} has approved a list of high
level detector specifications, including those listed above. These are
maintained in edms-xxxx, and the high level requirements with
significant impact on physics are highlighted in
Table~\ref{tab:dunephysicsreqs}.

The high level \dword{dune} requirements that drive the \dword{lbnf} design are
maintained in DocDB-112 and under change control. These are owned by
the \dword{dune} \dword{tc} and the \dword{lbnf} project manager.

Lower level detector specifications are held by the consortia and
described in the \dword{dune} \dword{tdr} \dword{dsp}
Volume~\volnumbersp\ and \dword{ddp} Volume~\volnumberdp\ chapters for
each consortium.
