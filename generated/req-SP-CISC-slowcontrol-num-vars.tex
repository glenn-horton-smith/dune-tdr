                & Name: Total No. of variables    \\ 
    Description & This is the total number of variables monitored by slow controls from all sub-systems of the detector.   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  > 150000  ( 150,000 - 200,000 ) \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   The total number of variables estimated here is based on extrapolation from ProtoDUNE-SP. The selected base software framework needs to be flexible enough to be able to handle large number of variables of the order of few 100k and monitor/archive them at the rates needed.  \\ \colhline
    Validation &   \\
