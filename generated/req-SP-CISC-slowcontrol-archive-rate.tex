                & Name: Archiving rate    \\ 
    Description & Slow control quantities will need to archived at a rate that ranges from 0.02 Hz to 1 per few minutes, depending on the slow controls quantity.   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  \SI{0.02}{Hz}  ( Broad range 1 Hz to 1 per few min. ) \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   Slow Controls will consist of tens of thousands of variables. These variables will be archived at a different rate depending on the rate of change expected for a given variable and sensitivity of the variable being monitored. The archiving rate will also be limited by how much data per second that one wishes to store.  \\ \colhline
    Validation &   \\
