    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-PDS-2}{ spec:spatial-localization } & Name: Spatial localization in $y$-$z$ plane \\
    Description & Events inside the active volume shall be localized in the Y-Z plane  to within < \SI{2.5}{\meter} using light signals.   \\  \colhline
    Specification &  $<\,\SI{2.5}{\meter}$ \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   Enables more accurate matching of photon detector and TPC signals.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & Supernova neutrino and nucleon decay simulation in the far detector.  \\
