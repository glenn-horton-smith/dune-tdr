                & Name: Unit size    \\ 
    Description & Overall dimensions of a single anode plane assembly   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &  \SI{6.0}{m} tall $\times$ \SI{2.3}{m} wide \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &  { APA size should be as large as possible to minimize inactive regions within the detector, with the maximum size limited by logistical factors regarding fabrication, transportation, and installation at the 4,850 ft. level at SURF.  } \\ \colhline
    Validation &{ ProtoDUNE-SP APAs of this size were successfully contructed and transported to CERN from the US and UK and installed in the ProtoDUNE cryostat.  } \\
