                & Name: Range in electron lifetime    \\ 
    Description & The purity monitors inside the cryostat should be capable of measuring a lifetime range between 0 and 10 ms. The goal for the inline purity monitors is to measure a range of 0 to 30 ms for the drift electron lifetime.   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  \SIrange{0}{10}{ms} (\SIrange{0}{30}{ms})  ( 0 - 10 ms (0 - 30 ms) ) \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   10 ms drift lifetime is better than any that has been observed in a large LAr TPC and by keeping the range to a minimum, then the precision of the purity monitors can be better. The LAr coming from the filter for the 35t reads ~25 ms, but has never reached 30 ms.  \\ \colhline
