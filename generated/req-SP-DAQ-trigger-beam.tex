                & Name: Trigger for Beam    \\ 
    Description & The detector shall trigger on the visible energy of beam interactions within the active volume with efficiency high enough that it has a sub-dominant impact on physics sensitivity.   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &  $>$\SI{100}{\MeV} \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &  { Study of these events is the primary DUNE mission } \\ \colhline
    Validation &{ Techniques for doing this have been run succesfully in MINOS, NOvA and T2K. 100 MeV is an achievable parameter; lower thresholds are possible. } \\
