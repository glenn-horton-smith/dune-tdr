                & Name: Spatial localization    \\ 
    Description & Events inside the active volume shall be localized in 3D  to within < \SI{100}{\cm} using light signals.   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  < \SI{100}{\cm}  ( < \SI{50}{\cm} ) \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   This facilitates TPC trackâ€“light signal matching and allows to restrict the portion of the TPC information to be acquired/saved. Need text here.   Is localization needed/helpful for the trigger?  \\ \colhline
    Validation & Need text here.  \\
