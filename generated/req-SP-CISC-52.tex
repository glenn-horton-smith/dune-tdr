    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-CISC-52}{ spec:slowcontrol-num-vars } & Name: Total No. of variables \\
    Description & This is the total number of variables monitored by slow controls from all subsystems of the detector.   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  $>\,\num{150000}$  ( \SIrange{150000}{200000} ) \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   Based on extrapolation from ProtoDUNE-SP. The selected base software framework should be able to handle (monitor/archive) that number of variables at rates needed.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & ProtoDUNE-SP and ITF  \\
