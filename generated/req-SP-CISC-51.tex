    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-CISC-51}{ spec:slowcontrol-alarm-rate } & Name: Alarm rate \\
    Description & The total number of alarms/day seen by operators need to be less than 150.   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  $<\,$150/day  ( $<\,$50/day ) \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   Definition of alarms should be such that the alarm rate is low enough to allow experiment operators to "respond" to every alarm.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & Validated with final detector, since it will  depend on experimental conditions  \\
