                & Name: Noise from Instrumentation devices    \\ 
    Description & The instrumentation devices shall contribute no more than \elecnoisefe of noise, with a goal of ALARA. This requirement is on total system noise;   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  $\ll \elecnoisefe$  ( ALARA ) \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   Based on extrapolations from SBND and as quoted by the CE consortium, a maximum acceptable noise level is ~1100e- for a 5/1 signal/noise ratio for a MIP passing near the cathode, expected to be dominated by cold electronics. ALARA=As Low As Reasonably Achievable;  \\ \colhline
    Validation &   \\
