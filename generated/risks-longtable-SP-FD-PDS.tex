ID & Risk & Mitigation & P & C & S  \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-001 & Insufficient light yield due to inefficient \dword{pds} design & Increase \dword{pmt} photo-cathode coverage and/or \dword{wls} reflector foils coverage. & L & M & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-002 & Poor coating quality for \dword{tpb} coated surfaces and \dword{lar} contamination by \dword{tpb} & Test quality and ageing properties of \dword{tpb} coating techniques. Elaborate improved techniques if needed. & M & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-003 & \dword{pmt} channel loss due to faulty \dword{pmt} base design & Improve \dword{pmt} base design from analysis of possible failure modes in \dword{pddp}. Optimize clustering algorithms to mitigate possible chanel loss. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-004 & Bad \dword{pmt} channel due to faulty connection between \dword{hv}/signal cable and \dword{pmt} base & Enhcanced connectivity tests in \lntwo prior to installation. Optimize clustering algorithms to mitigate possible chanel loss. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-005 & Incorrect choice of feedthroughs for the cabling and installation in the cryostat & Improve feedthrough design in case unsatisfactory noise levels during \dword{pddp} operations are present. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-006 & \dword{pmt} signal saturation & Tuning of \dword{pmt} gains. In the worst case, redesign front-end electronics to adjust the analog input range of ADC. & M & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-007 & Excessive electronics noise to distinguish \dword{lar} scintillation light & Measurement of noise levels during commissioning prior to \lar filling. Modifications to grounding, shielding, or power distribution schemes. & M & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-008 & Availability of resources for work at the installation/integration site less than planned & Move expert personnel temporarily from institutions involved in the \dword{pds}consortium to the integration/installation site. & M & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-009 & Damage of \dwords{pmt} during shipment to the experiment site & Special packaging to avoid possible \dword{pmt} damage during shipment. Contingency of \num{ 10}\% spare \dwords{pmt}. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-010 & Damage of optical fibers during installation & Fibers will be the last \dual \dword{pds} item to be installed. Detailed documentation for all \dual \dword{pds} installation tasks.   & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-011 & Excessive exposure to ambient light of \dword{tpb} coated surfaces, resulting in degraded performance & \dword{tpb} coated surfaces temporarily covered until cryostat closing. Detailed installation procedure to minimize exposure to ambient light. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-012 & \dword{pmt} implosion during \dword{lar} filling & No mitigation necessary, considering \SI{7}{bar} pressure rating of \dwords{pmt} and experience with same/similar \dwords{pmt} in other large liquid detectors. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-013 & Insufficient light yield due to poor \dword{lar} purity & Procurement of \dword{lar} from the manufacturer will require less than \SI{3}{ppm} in nitrogen. & M & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-014 & \dword{pmt} channel or \dword{pds} sector loss due to failures in \dword{hv}/signal rack & Ease of maintenance outside cryostat and availability of spares for all components of at least one \dword{hv}/signal rack. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-015 & Unstable response of the photon detection system over the lifetime of the experiment & Channel-level instabilities corrected via light calibration system. Detector-level instabilities corrected via cosmic-ray muon calibration data. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
