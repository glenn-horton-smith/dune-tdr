                & Name: This is another example; delete this row: This is another example: Drift field uniformity throughout volume    \\ 
    Description & Misalignments of the various TPC components should not introduce drift field non-uniformities beyond those specified in the HVS requirements   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &  $<1$\%  \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &  { Inhomogeneities in the field will degrade reconstruction performance. Misalignments of TPC components could introduce drift field non-uniformities beyond those specified in the HVS requirements. } \\ \colhline
    Validation &{ Example: "Space charge in ProtoDUNE will complicate the analysis of the field uniformity. Local effects close to the FC electrodes might be disentaglable, exploiting through-going muon tracks. Simulations of misalignments of $<$1\% do not significantly affect reconstruction."  } \\
