    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-APA-4}{ spec:apa-bias-voltage } & Name: Wire plane bias voltages \\
    Description & APAs should produce optimal and uniform induction and collection signal shapes.   \\  \colhline
    Specification &  The setup, including boards, must hold 150\% of max operating voltage. \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   Headroom in case adjustments needed  \\ \colhline
    Validation & E-field simulation sets wire bias voltages. ProtoDUNE-SP confirms performance.  \\
