                & Name: Gaps between APAs     \\ 
    Description & The gap size between APAs shall minimize loss of fiducial volume and distortion of charge collection.   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  $<\,\SI{15}{mm}$ between APAs on same support beam; $<\,\SI{30}{mm}$ between APAs on different support beams  ( ALARA ) \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   Allowing gaps to open up between some APAs will reduce the overall shrinkage of the detector.  This also simplifies construction and installation of the detector support structure. Use of electron diverters should minimize impact of gaps, based on simulation.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & Effect of gaps between APAs (and effectiveness of installed electron diverters) on track reconstruction will be studied using the ProtoDUNE data.  \\
