\rowcolor{dunesky}
ID & Risk & Mitigation & P & C & S  \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-01 & Insufficient light yield due to inefficient PDS design & Increase coverage of \dword{pmt} photo-cathodes and/or \dword{wls} reflector foils. & L & M & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-02 & Poor coating quality for \dword{tpb} coated surfaces and \dword{lar} contamination by \dword{tpb} & Test quality and ageing properties of \dword{tpb} coating techniques. Improve techniques if needed. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-03 & \dword{pmt} channel loss due to faulty \dword{pmt} base design & Optimize clustering algorithms. Improve \dword{pmt} base design from analysis of possible failure modes in \dword{pddp}. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-04 & Bad \dword{pmt} channel due to faulty connection between \dword{hv}/signal cable and \dword{pmt} base & Optimize clustering algorithms. Test connectivity in \lntwo prior to installation. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-05 & \dword{pmt} signal saturation & Tune \dword{pmt} gain. In worst case, redesign \dword{fe} to adjust to analog input range of \dword{adc}. & M & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-06 & Excessive electronics noise to distinguish \dword{lar} scintillation light & Measure noise levels during commissioning prior to \lar filling. Modify grounding, shielding, or power distribution schemes. & M & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-07 & Availability of resources for work at the installation/integration site less than planned & Bring consortium members to the integration/installation site. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-08 & Damage of \dwords{pmt} during shipment to the experiment site & Use special packaging to avoid damage during shipment. Plan for 10\% spare  \dwords{pmt}. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-09 & Damage of optical fibers during installation & Install fibers last. Provide detailed installation procedures.   & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-10 & Excessive exposure to ambient light of \dword{tpb} coated surfaces, resulting in degraded performance & Cover \dword{tpb} coated surfaces until cryostat closing. Include in installation procedure: minimize exposure to ambient light. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-11 & \dword{pmt} implosion during \dword{lar} filling & No mitigation necessary, per \dword{pmt} \SI{7}{bar} pressure rating and experience with similar \dwords{pmt} in  large liquid detectors. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-12 & Insufficient light yield due to poor \dword{lar} purity & Procure \dword{lar} with less than 3 ppm nitrogen. & M & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-13 & \dword{pmt} channel or \dword{pds} sector loss due to failures in \dword{hv}/signal rack & Access/replace components easily outside cryostat and provide spares for all components for at least one \dword{hv}/signal rack. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-PDS-14 & Unstable response of the photon detection system over the lifetime of the experiment & Correct channel-level instabilities via light calibration system. Correct detector-level instabilities via cosmic-ray muon calibration data. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
