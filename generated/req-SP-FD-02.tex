    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-FD-2}{ spec:system-noise } & Name: System noise \\
    Description & The total system noise seen by each wire should be no more than 1000 enc of noise. It is expected that random noise on the FE amplifier will be the dominant contribution to the total system noise.   \\  \colhline
    Specification &  $<\,\SI{1000}{enc}$ \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   Provides $>$5:1 S/N on induction planes for  pattern recognition and two-track separation.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & ProtoDUNE and simulation  \\
