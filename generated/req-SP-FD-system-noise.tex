                & Name: System noise    \\ 
    Description & The total system noise seen by each wire should be no more than 1000 enc of noise, with a goal of ALARA. It is expected that random noise on the FE amplifier will be the dominant contribution to the total system noise.   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  $<\,\SI{1000}{enc}$  ( ALARA ) \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   The noise specification is driven by pattern recognition and two-track separation.  Studies suggest that a minimum of ~5/1 signal to noise ratio on individual wire measurements allows for sufficient reconstruction performance. Converting this signal to noise ratio to ENC on an induction plane signal for a MIP with minimum signal yields the figure of system-noise. The corresponding ratio on the collection wires is  approximately 13/1.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & ProtoDUNE will demonstrate the noise level achievable by the current electronics and validate the grounding and shielding rules being used. Simulation will quantify how physics reach is correlated to electronics noise for selected physics channels.  \\
