                & Name: Detector dead time    \\ 
    Description & The down time of the detector should be such that data taking interruptions affecting all active cryostats are kept below $<$0.5\% with a goal of ALARA   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  $<\,\SI{0.5}{\%}$  ( ALARA ) \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   In order to collect the required physics data, the detector must operate stably over long time periods. The specification is driven by the risk of missing a supernova burst if all operating cryostats are offline.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & Operation of the ProtoDUNE detector will provide information on the stability of the HVS over time.    \\
