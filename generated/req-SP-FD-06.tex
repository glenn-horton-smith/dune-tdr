    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-FD-6}{ spec:apa-gaps } & Name: Gaps between APAs  \\
    Description & The gap size between APAs shall minimize loss of fiducial volume and distortion of charge collection.   \\  \colhline
    Specification &  $<\,\SI{15}{mm}$ between APAs on same support beam; $<\,\SI{30}{mm}$ between APAs on different support beams \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   Maintains fiducial volume.  Simplified contruction.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & ProtoDUNE  \\
