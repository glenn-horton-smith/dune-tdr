                & Name: Dead channels    \\ 
    Description & Detector components shall be sufficiently reliable so as to ensure that dead channels do not exceed 1\% over the lifetime of the experiment.   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  $<\,\SI{1}{\%}$  ( ALARA ) \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   Detector needs to operate over a 20-30 year liftime with components that will be inaccessible post-installation, so components must be robust against damage during installation/cooldown and have long-term stability.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & ProtoDUNE will identify infant mortality rates for the current detector components.  Additional cosmic-ray operation in 2019 will validate longer-term stability.  \\
