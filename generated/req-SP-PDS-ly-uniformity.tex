                & Name: Light yield uniformity    \\ 
    Description & The light yield uniformity shall remain less than 50\%. (from Anne: Can you please clarify what this means, e.g., "For a given signal anywhere in the fiducial volume, the amount of light collected on the PDS shall be uniform to within 50\%" or whatever it actually means)   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  < \num{50}\%  ( < \num{20}\% ) \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   Light yield uniformity within the active volume. The uniformity in the light yield  helps significantly in the rejection of low energy background, especially the 39Ar (beta spectrum with end point at 565 keV). This isotope is present at a level of 1 Bq/kg in natural argon and will cause a large number of signals in the PD system, originated by nearby decays. Uniformity allows to improve energy resolution of the detector through calorimetric measurements based on light.   \\ \colhline
