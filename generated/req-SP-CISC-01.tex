    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-CISC-1}{ spec:inst-noise } & Name: Noise from Instrumentation devices \\
    Description & The instrumentation devices shall contribute no more than \SI{1000}{enc} of noise, with a goal of ALARA. This requirement is on total system noise, which is expected to be dominated by cold electronics.    \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  $\ll\,\SI{1000}{enc}$  ( ALARA ) \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   Based on extrapolations from SBND and as quoted by the CE consortium, this is the maximum noise for a 5:1 signal/noise ratio for a MIP passing near the cathode  \\ \colhline
    Validation & ProtoDUNE will demonstrate the noise level achievable by the current readout electronics and validate the grounding and shielding rules being used.  \\
