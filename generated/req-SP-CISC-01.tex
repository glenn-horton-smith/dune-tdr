    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-CISC-1}{ spec:inst-noise } & Name: Noise from Instrumentation devices \\
    Description & The instrumentation devices shall contribute no more than \SI{1000}{enc} of noise. This requirement is on total system noise, which is expected to be dominated by cold electronics.    \\  \colhline
    Specification &  $\ll\,\SI{1000}{enc}$ \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   Max noise for 5:1 S/N for a MIP passing near cathode; per SBND and DUNE CE  \\ \colhline
    Validation & ProtoDUNE  \\
