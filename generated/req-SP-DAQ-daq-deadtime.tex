                & Name: DAQ Deadtime    \\ 
    Description & The DAQ shall operate with deadtime that does not contribute significantly to overall loss of detector livetime.   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &   \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &  { Zero deadtime makes physics analysis bookeeping for overall livetime much simpler, and allows acquisition of neutrino events even with accidentals from backgrounds such as radiologicals. } \\ \colhline
    Validation &{ Zero deadtime is an achievable inter-event deadtime but a small deadtime would not significantly compromise physics sensitivity. } \\
