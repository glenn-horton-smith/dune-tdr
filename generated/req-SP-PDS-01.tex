    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-PDS-1}{ spec:ly-uniformity } & Name: Light yield uniformity within the active volume. \\
    Description & The light yield in even the dimmest regions of the detector shall be sufficient to correctly associate scintillation light with events with energy > 200 MeV with efficiency >\SI{99}{\%}. The goal is to dramatically improve the uniformity to improve background rejection, triggering efficiency, and energy resolution.   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  $>\,\SI{0.5}{pe/MeV}$  ( >\SI{4}{pe/MeV} ) \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   Fiducializing nucleon decay backgrounds with  $>\,\SI{99}{\%}$ efficiency at all points in the detector.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & Simulated nucleon decay events in the far detector.  \\
