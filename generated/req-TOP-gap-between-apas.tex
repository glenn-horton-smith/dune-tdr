                & Name: This is an example; delete this row: Gap width between adjacent APAs    \\ 
    Description & Loss of fiducial volume or distortion of charge collection near APA gaps should be minimized. Use of electron diverters should minimize impact based on simulation.   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &  $<$\SI{20}{\milli\meter} \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &  { Some gap is necessary to allow for detector shrinkage. Installation of electron diverters can mitigate effects of small gaps on reconstruction. } \\ \colhline
    Validation &{ Example: "Good reconstruction efficiency obtained for tracks crossing APA boundaries. Simulations of 10-50 mm gaps showed slight and gradual drop in efficiency over 20 mm." } \\
