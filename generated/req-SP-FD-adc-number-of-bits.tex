                & Name: Number of ADC bits    \\ 
    Description & The ADC shall digitize the charge deposited on the wires with12 bits precision.   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  \num{12} bits  ( \num{13} bits ) \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   The lower end of the ADC dynamic range is driven by the requirement that the
ADC digitization does not contribute to the total electronics noise. The upper end of the ADC dynamic range is defined by the previous requirement on the signal saturation level. Combining these two requirements with the specification for the
total electronics noise results in a the need for a 12 bits digitization.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & No validation required; this is a design choice.  \\
