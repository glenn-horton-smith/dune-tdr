    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-CISC-11}{ spec:temp-repro } & Name: Precision: temperature reproducibility \\
    Description & The RMS of the distribution of independent temperature offsets between two sensors in successive immersions in LAr should be $<$ 5  mK   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  $<\,\SI{5}{mK}$  ( \SI{2}{mK} ) \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   To enable validation of CFD models, which predicts gradients below 15 mK  \\ \colhline
    Validation & ProtoDUNE-SP and ITF  \\
   \colhline
