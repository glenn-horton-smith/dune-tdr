                & Name: Off-beam High-energy Trigger    \\ 
    Description & The detector shall trigger on the visible energy of underground physics events from decays or interactions within the active volume with high efficiency.   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &  $>$\SI{100}{\MeV} \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &  { Study of these events (atmospheric neutrinos, baryon-number-violating events) is part of the DUNE mission.  Cosmic rays are also essential for calibration. } \\ \colhline
    Validation &{ Refer to physics TDR. 100 MeV is an achievable parameter; lower thesholds are possible. } \\
