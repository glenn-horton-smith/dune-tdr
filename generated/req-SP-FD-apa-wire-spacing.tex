                & Name: APA wire spacing    \\ 
    Description & The wire spacing shall be chosen as a compromise between good S/N (coarser pitch) and good vertex resolution (finer pitch).   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &  \SI{4.669}{mm} for U,V; \SI{4.790}{mm} for X,G \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   S/N consistent with 100\% hit reconstruction efficiency for MIPs.  Spacing fine enough to provide \SI{1.5}{cm} vertex resolution in $y-z$ plane.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & No validation required; this is a design choice. Monte Carlo studies have been performed showing no significant difference in sensitivity to CP violation for smaller wire spacing.  \\
