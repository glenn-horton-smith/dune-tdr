    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-FD-11}{ spec:hvs-field-uniformity } & Name: Drift field uniformity due to HVS \\
    Description & Design of TPC cathode and FC components shall ensure uniform field.  Production tolerances shall be set so as to maintain flatness of component surfaces and, by extension, the shape of the drift field volume.   \\  \colhline
    Specification &  $<\,\SI{1}{\%}$ throughout volume \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   High reconstruction efficiency.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & ProtoDUNE and simulation  \\
