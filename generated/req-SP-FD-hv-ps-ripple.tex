                & Name: Cathode HV power supply ripple contribution to system noise    \\ 
    Description & Power supply ripple shall be adequately attenuated to guarantee that its contribution to the overall system electronics noise  is negligible.   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  $<\,\SI{100}{enc}$  ( ALARA ) \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &     \\ \colhline
    Validation & Effect of HV system on the baseline electronics noise should be easily measured by switching on and off the HV power supply.  Equivalent full circuit simulation of the coupling between the HVS and the FE electronics will be performed to compare against ProtoDUNE data and validate the FD design.  \\
