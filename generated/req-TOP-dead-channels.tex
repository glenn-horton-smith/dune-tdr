                & Name: Dead channels    \\ 
    Description & Detector components shall be sufficiently reliable so as to ensure that dead channels do not exceed 1\% over the lifetime of the experiment.   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &  < \num{1}\% \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &  { Detector needs to operate over a 20-30 year liftime with components that will be inaccessible post-installation. } \\ \colhline
    Validation &{ ProtoDUNE will identify infant mortality rates for the current detector components.  Additional cosmic-ray operation in 2019 will validate longer-term stability. } \\
