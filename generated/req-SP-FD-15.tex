    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-FD-15}{ spec:lar-n-contamination } & Name: LAr nitrogen contamination \\
    Description & The nitrogen contamination in the LAr shall remain below 25 ppm in order not to significantly affect the number of photons that reach the detectors (for both fast and late light components).   \\  \colhline
    Specification &  $<\,\SI{25}{ppm}$ \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   Maintain \SI{0.5}{PE/MeV} PDS sensitivity required for triggering proton decay near cathode.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & In situ measurment  \\
   \colhline
