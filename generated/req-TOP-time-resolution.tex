                & Name: Time resolution    \\ 
    Description & The time resolution shall be less than \num{1} microsecond in order to assign a unique event time.   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &  < \SI{1}{\micro\second} \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &  { Based on the minimal energy deposition (10 MeV), spatial separation (\SI{1}{m}), and temporal separation (\SI{1}{ms}) for which one wants to assign a unique event time. Time resolution of \SI{1}{\micro\second} is required to have position resolution along the drift direction of about \SI{1}{mm}. } \\ \colhline
