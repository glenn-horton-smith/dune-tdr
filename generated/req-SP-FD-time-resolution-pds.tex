                & Name: Time resolution    \\ 
    Description & The time resolution of the photon detection system shall be less than 1 microsecond in order to assign a unique event time.   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  $<\,\SI{1}{\micro\second}$  ( $<\,\SI{100}{\nano\second}$ ) \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   Based on the minimal energy deposition (10 MeV), spatial separation (\SI{1}{m}), and temporal separation (\SI{1}{ms}) for which one wants to assign a unique event time. Time resolution of \SI{1}{\micro\second} is required to have position resolution along the drift direction of about \SI{1}{mm}.  \\ \colhline
    Validation &   \\
