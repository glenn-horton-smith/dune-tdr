                & Name: Front-end electronics noise    \\ 
    Description & The FE electronics shall contribute no more than \num{1000} enc of noise, with a goal of ALARA. This requirement is on total system noise; it is expected that random noise on the FE will dominate.   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &  < \num{1000} enc \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &  { Driven by pattern recognition and two-track separation requirements.  Requirement of 5/1 signal to noise ratio on individual ADC wire measurements yields the figure of \num{1000} enc for the induction wires. } \\ \colhline
    Validation &{ ProtoDUNE will demonstrate the noise level achievable by the current electronics and validate the grounding and shielding rules being used. Simulation will quantify how physics reach is correlated to electronics noise for selected physics channels. } \\
