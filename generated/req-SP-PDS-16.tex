    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-PDS-16}{ spec:pds-dynamicrange } & Name: Dynamic Range in SP-PD \\
    Description & The dynamic range shall be large enough that no more than \SI{20}{\%}  of expected beam events have channels which saturate.   \\  \colhline
    Specification &  $<\,\SI{20}{\%}$ \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   Keep the rate of saturating channels low enough for effective mitigation.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & Neutrino beam simulation  \\
