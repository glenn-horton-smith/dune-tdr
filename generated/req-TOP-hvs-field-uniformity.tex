                & Name: Drift field uniformity due to HVS    \\ 
    Description & Design of TPC cathode and FC components shall ensure uniform field.  Production tolerances shall be set so as to maintain flatness of component surfaces and, by extension, the shape of the drift field volume.   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &  < \num{1}\% throughout volume \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &  { Non-uniformity of \efield affects 3D reconstruction due to introduction of non-constant electron drift velocity, including residual transverse components with respect to the nominal drift direction. } \\ \colhline
    Validation &{ Space charge in ProtoDUNE will complicate the analysis of the field uniformity. Local effects close to the field cage electrodes could be in principle be disentagled, exploiting through-going muon tracks. Simulation will be used to determine fiducial volume cuts, with input from the ProtoDUNE data. } \\
