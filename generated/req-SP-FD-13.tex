    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-FD-13}{ spec:fe-peak-time } & Name: Front-end peaking time \\
    Description & The FE peaking time shall be set so as to optimize vertex resolution.    \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  \SI{1}{\micro\second}  ( Adjustable so as to see saturation in less than \SI{10}{\%} of beam-produced events ) \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   Vertex resolution; optimized for \SI{5}{mm} wire spacing.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & ProtoDUNE and simulation  \\
   \colhline
