                & Name: Light yield    \\ 
    Description & The light yield shall be sufficient for measuring event time (and total intensity) of events with visible energy above \SI{200}{MeV}.  Goal is to make possible a \num{10}\% energy measurement for events with a visible energy of \SI{10}{MeV}.   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &  > \num{0.5} pe/MeV \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &  { Minimal requirement is based on events occuring near the cathode, for which the produced photons need to travel furthest to reach the photon detectors. } \\ \colhline
    Validation &{  } \\
