    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-FD-5}{ spec:lar-purity } & Name: Liquid argon purity \\
    Description & The LAr purity shall remain lower than 100 ppt (with a goal of < 30 ppt). This corresponds to e- lifetime of 3 (10) ms.   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  $<$\,\SI{100}{ppt}  ( $<\,\SI{30}{ppt}$ ) \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   Provides $>$5:1 S/N on induction planes for  pattern recognition and two-track separation.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & Purity monitors and cosmic ray tracks  \\
