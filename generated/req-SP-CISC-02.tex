    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-CISC-2}{ spec:inst-efield } & Name: Max. E-field near instrumentation devices \\
    Description & The maximum field near instrumentation devices should be $<\,\SI{30}{kV/cm}$ to avoid dielectric breakdowns.   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  $<\,\SI{30}{kV/cm}$  ( $<\,\SI{15}{kV/cm}$ ) \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   Keep it significantly lower than the maximum field recommended by the HV group, which is 30 kV/cm  \\ \colhline
    Validation & Use Comsol electrostatic simulation software with the full 3D geometry to compute the field in all surfaces.  \\
