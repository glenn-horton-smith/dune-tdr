    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-FD-23}{ spec:sn-trigger } & Name: Supernova trigger \\
    Description & The DAQ architecture shall provide a mechanism for triggering on galactic supernova bursts and recording neutrino interactions associated with those bursts over a 30 second period, with a goal of 100 seconds. During this period, sufficient information must be recorded to allow reconstruction of $>$90\% of neutrino interactions.   \\  \colhline
    Specification &  $>\,\SI{90}{\%}$ efficiency for SNB within \SI{100}{kpc} \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   $>\,$90\% efficiency for SNB within 100 kpc  \\ \colhline
    Validation & Simulation and bench tests  \\
