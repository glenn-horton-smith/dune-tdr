    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-FD-3}{ spec:light-yield } & Name: Light yield \\
    Description & The light yield shall be sufficient for measuring event time (and total intensity) of events with visible energy above 200 MeV.  Goal is to make possible a 10\% energy measurement for events with a visible energy of 10 MeV.   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  $>\,\SI{0.5}{pe/MeV}$  ( $>\,\SI{5}{pe/MeV}$ ) \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   Rejects nucleon decay backgrounds from cosmogenic events near cathode.  \\ \colhline
    Validation &   \\
