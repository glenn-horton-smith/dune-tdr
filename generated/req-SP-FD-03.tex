    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-FD-3}{ spec:light-yield } & Name: Light yield \\
    Description & The average light yield shall be sufficient to enable triggering on neutrinos from supernova bursts and the measurement of their energy with \num{30}\% resolution at \SI{10}{MeV}.   \\  \colhline
    Specification &  $>\,\SI{13}{pe/MeV}$ \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   Corresponds to point where improvements in resolution with increasing light yield slow down significantly.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & Simulated SN neutrinos in FD.  \\
