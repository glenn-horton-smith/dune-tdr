                & Name: Maintain detector location at LAr temperature.     \\ 
    Description & No absolute number is required for physics. The requirement is driven by engineering to ensure no damage occurs.   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &  (what is required to avoid damage) \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &  { Accommodate shrinkage of the detector and APA itself. SP-PD must accommodate variation of cable, cable connector, and mecchanical support locations. } \\ \colhline
    Validation &{ Need text here. } \\
