                & Name: Light yield    \\ 
    Description & The light yield shall be sufficient for measuring event time (and total intensity) of events with visible energy above 200 MeV.  Goal is to make possible a 10\% energy measurement for events with a visible energy of 10 MeV.   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  $>\,\SI{0.5}{pe/MeV}$  ( $>\,\SI{5}{pe/MeV}$ ) \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   Minimal requirement is based on rejecting background to nucleon decay events occuring near the cathode, for which the produced photons need to travel furthest to reach the photon detectors.  \\ \colhline
    Validation &   \\
