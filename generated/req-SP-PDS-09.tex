    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-PDS-9}{ spec:mech-compatibility } & Name: No mechanical interference with APA, SP-CE and SP-HV detector elements (clearance) \\
    Description & SP-PD system, including cables and mechanical supports, must fit within APA and not interfere with SP-CE.   \\  \colhline
    Specification &  $>\,\SI{1}{\milli\meter}$ \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   PD mounting and securing element tolerances must prevent interference with APA and CE cable bundles  \\ \colhline
    Validation &  ICEBERG, Ash River integration  tests, CERN pre-production integration test  \\
