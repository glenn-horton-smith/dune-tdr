                & Name: Drift field uniformity due to component alignment    \\ 
    Description & Misalignments of the various TPC components shall not introduce drift-field nonuniformities beyond those specified in the HVS requirements.   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  $<\,1\,$\% throughout volume  ( ALARA ) \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   DSS should provide support such that the APA, CPA and FC can maintain rectangular parallelepiped under LAr conditions. Specifically the rails should remain parallel to each other at a fixed distance throughout the detector volume  \\ \colhline
    Validation & Space charge in ProtoDUNE will complicate the analysis of the field uniformity. Local effects close to the field cage electrodes could be in principle be disentagled, exploiting through-going muon tracks.   \\
