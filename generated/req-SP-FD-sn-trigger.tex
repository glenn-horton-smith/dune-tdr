                & Name: Supernova trigger    \\ 
    Description & The DAQ architecture shall provide a mechanism for triggering on galactic supernova bursts and recording neutrino interactions associated with those bursts over a 30 second period, with a goal of 100 seconds. During this period, sufficient information must be recorded to allow reconstruction of $>$90\% of neutrino interactions.   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &  $>\,\SI{90}{\%}$ efficiency for SNB within \SI{100}{kpc} \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   Most models of SNB show structure in the neutrino flux for up to 30s and there is potential for interesting measurements to be made up to 100s. 90\% triggering efficiency for a typical burst out to 100 kpc provides sensitivity to SNB in our galaxy and several small nearby galaxies.  \\ \colhline
