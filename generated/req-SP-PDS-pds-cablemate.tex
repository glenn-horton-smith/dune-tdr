                & Name: Upper-Lower APA junction gap    \\ 
    Description & The PD cabling system must allow for the upper and lower APAs to mate with a maximum \SI{6}{\milli\meter} gap between APA frame footer tubes.   \\  \colhline
    
    Specification &  $<$\SI{6}{\milli\meter} \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &  { During detector integration, APA stacks of 2 APAs are made up.  As the PD cabling will already be mounted inside the APAs, a method to allow those connections to be made while allowing the APAs to mate to within 6mm must be designed and implemented. } \\ \colhline
    Validation &{ Need text here. } \\
