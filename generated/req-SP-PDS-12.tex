    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-PDS-12}{ spec:pds-clearance } & Name: Maintain PD-APA clearance at LAr temperature.  \\
    Description & The clearance for the PDs in the APA slots must remain above .5mm after cooldown. No absolute number is required for physics. The specification is driven by engineering to ensure no damage occurs.  Following cryogenic cooldown, the 1mm total separation specified in requirement  8 (apa-install) will be reduced to a total of 0.5mm   \\  \colhline
    Specification &  $>\,\SI{0.5}{\milli\meter}$ \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   PD mounting frame and cable harness must accommodate thermal contraction of itself and APA frame  \\ \colhline
    Validation & Thermal modeling, ProtoDUNE, ICEBERG, CERN Pre-Production Integration Tests  \\
