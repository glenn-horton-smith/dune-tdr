    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-PDS-12}{ spec:pds-location } & Name: Maintain detector location at LAr temperature.  \\
    Description & No absolute number is required for physics. The requirement is driven by engineering to ensure no damage occurs.  Following cryogenic cooldown, the 1mm total separation specified in requirement ID 8 (apa-install) shall be reduced to a total of 0.5mm   \\  \colhline
    Specification &  $>\,\SI{0.5}{\milli\meter}$ \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   PD mounting frame and cable harness must accommodate thermal contraction of itself and APA frame  \\ \colhline
    Validation & Thermal modeling, ProtoDUNE, ICEBERG, CERN Pre-Production Integration Tests  \\
