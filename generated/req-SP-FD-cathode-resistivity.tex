                & Name: Cathode resistivity    \\ 
    Description & The cathode resistivity shall ensure that in the event of an HV discharge, the release of the large stored energy is spread out over time.    \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  $>\,\SI{1}{\mega\ohm/square}$  ( $>\,\SI{1}{\giga\ohm/square}$ ) \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   This prevents damage to detector components. The goal resistivity is > \SI{1}{\giga\ohm}/sq  \\ \colhline
    Validation & In ProtoDUNE the resistivity of the CPA panels  is in the MW/sq range due to the detector being operated on the surface.  There will be opportunities to test if the front-end electronics is adeguately protected against discharges (hopefully at the end of beam operations).  Existing discharge simulations can be tuned based on ProtoDUNE data to better validate far detector designs.  \\
