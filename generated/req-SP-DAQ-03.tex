    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-DAQ-3}{ spec:trigger-beam } & Name: Beam Trigger \\
    Description & The detector shall trigger on the visible energy of beam interactions within the active volume with efficiency high enough that it has a sub-dominant impact on physics sensitivity.   \\  \colhline
    Specification &  $>$\SI{100}{\MeV} \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   Driven by DUNE physics mission.  \\ \colhline
    Validation & Simulations, experience from past and ongoing experiments.  \\
