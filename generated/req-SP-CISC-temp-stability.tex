                & Name: Stability    \\ 
    Description & The thermometers should match precision requirement at all places, at all times   \\  \colhline
    Specification (Goal) &  < \SI{2}{mK} at all places and times  ( Match precision requirement at all places, at all times ) \\   \colhline
    
    Rationale &   The stability of the thermometers should be such that they meet the required precision and can hold this for the entire duration of their operations. Their longevity is defined as the time they are stable.  \\ \colhline
    Validation &   \\
