    \\ \rowcolor{dunesky} \newtag{SP-PDS-3}{ spec:env-light-exposure } & Name: Environmental light exposure \\
    Description & Blue/UV Light exposure to the PD modules should be minimized.  No exposure to sunlight at any time.  UV-Filtered light (>\SI{400}{nm}) during all exposure.   \\  \colhline
    Specification &  \num{0} sunlight.Â  All other unfiltered sources: $<\,\num{30}$ minutes integrated across all exposures \\   \colhline
    Rationale &   Prevent damage to wavelength-shifting coatings due to UV exposure  \\ \colhline
    Validation & ProtoDUNE, IU studies  \\
