\subsubsection{Off-axis Neutrino Flux and Uncertainties}
\label{sec:tools-app-flx-offaxis}

The neutrino flux has a broad angular distribution and extends outward at the \dword{nd} hall. At an ``off-axis'' angle relative to the initial beam direction, the subsequent neutrino energy spectrum is narrower and peaked at a lower energy than the on-axis spectrum.
The relationship between the parent pion energy and neutrino energy is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:OAAFluxFigs}.  At \SI{575}{m}, the location of the \dword{nd} hall, a lateral shift of \SI{1}{m} corresponds to approximately a \ang{0.1} change in off-axis angle.

The intrinsic neutrino flavor content of the beam varies with off-axis angle. Figure~\ref{fig:OffAxisFluxes_1D_AllSpec} shows the neutrino-mode and anti-neutrino-mode predictions for the four neutrino flavors at the on-axis position, and a moderately off-axis position. At the \SI{30}{m} position, a second, smaller energy peak at approximately \SI{4}{\GeV} is due to the charged kaon neutrino parents. 
%As both the pion and kaon-parent peaks are significantly narrower in observed neutrino energy at greater off-axis angle, this which may allow for off-axis kaon-parent analyses.

%\fixme{Fig~\ref{fig:OffAxisFluxes_1D_AllSpec} is partly redundant with earlier figure, nice if it can be merged? }
%ZP: Changed previous plot. Unlike this one it shows all of the neutrino species broken by parent and it is on linear scale. Here useful to have comparison on vs offaxis and on log scale

(b) The neutrino-mode, muon-flavor predicted flux, separated by the particle that decayed to produce the neutrino. The off-axis spectrum displays a double peak structure due to charged kaon parent decay kinematics. The on-axis kaon-peak occurs at higher neutrino energy and will have a significantly broader energy spread.

%ZP: not sure what was the issue. looks fine to me now

The same sources of systematic uncertainty that affect the on-axis spectra also modify the off-axis spectra. 
Figure \ref{fig:onvsoff_flux_uncertainty} shows the on-axis and off-axis hadron production and focusing uncertainties. 
Generally, the size of the off-axis uncertainties is comparable to the on-axis uncertainties and the uncertainties are highly correlated across off-axis and on-axis positions. While the hadron production uncertainties are similar in size, the focusing uncertainties, are smaller for the off-axis flux. The systematic effects have different shape as function of neutrino energy at different off-axis locations making off-axis flux measurements useful to diagnose beamline physics. Measuring on-axis and off-axis flux breaks degeneracy between various systematics and allows better flux constraint.
