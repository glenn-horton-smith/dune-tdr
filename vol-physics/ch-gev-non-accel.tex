\section{Nucleon decay}
\label{sec:nonaccel-ndk}

\subsection{Predictions from Grand Unified Theories and current experimental status}
\label{subsec:nonaccel-ndk-status}

Unification of three of the fundamental forces in the universe, the strong, 
electromagnetic and weak interactions, is a central paradigm for the current 
world-wide program in particle physics. Grand Unified Theories (GUTs), aiming 
at extending the standard model of particle physics to include a unified force 
at very high energies  (above $10^{15}$ GeV), predict a number of observable 
effects at low energies, such as nucleon  decay \cite{Pati:1973rp,Georgi:1974sy,Dimopoulos:1981dw,Langacker:1980js,deBoer:1994dg,Nath:2006ut}. Several experiments have been searching for signatures of nucleon decay, with the best limits for most decay modes set by the \superk experiment~\cite{Miura:2016krn,Abe:2014mwa,TheSuper-Kamiokande:2017tit}, 
which features the largest sensitive mass and exposure to date. 

Although no evidence for proton decay has been detected, lifetime limits from the current generation of experiments already constrain many GUT models, as shown in Figure\todo{Current limit plot - Ed is making it}. In some cases, these limits are approaching the upper bounds of what these models will allow. This situation points naturally toward continuing the search with new, highly capable underground detectors, especially those with improved sensitivity to specific proton decay modes favored by GUT models. Given \superk's long exposure time (more than 30~years), extending the lifetime limits will require detectors with larger sensitive mass or improved detection efficiency and background rejection.  

The excellent imaging, calorimetric and particle identification capabilities of the LArTPC technology being implemented for the DUNE far detector will exploit multiple complementary signatures for a broad range of nucleon decay channels.  Should nucleon decay rates lie just beyond current limits, observation of even just one or two candidate events could constitute compelling evidence.

In the DUNE era, two other large detectors, \hyperk~\cite{Abe:2018uyc} and JUNO~\cite{Djurcic:2015vqa} will be conducting nucleon decay searches. Should a signal be observed by any single experiment, confirmation from experiments with different detector technologies and therefore different backgrounds would be very powerful.

The models present two benchmark decay modes.  The decay $p \rightarrow e^{+}\pi^0$ arises from gauge mediation and is often predicted to have the higher branching fraction of the two key modes. In this mode, the total mass of the proton is converted into the electromagnetic shower energy of the positron and two photons from $\pi^0$ decay, with a net momentum vector near zero. 
The second key mode is $p \rightarrow \bar{\nu}K^{+}$. This mode is dominant in most supersymmetric GUTs, many of which also favor other modes involving kaons in the final state.
Although significant attention will be focused on the above benchmark modes, the nucleon decay program at DUNE will be a broad effort.

\subsection{Experimental signatures for nucleon decay searches in DUNE}
\label{subsec:nonaccel-ndk-dune}

The DUNE far detector, as the largest active volume of argon, 
will be highly sensitive to a number of possible nucleon decay modes, 
in many cases complementing the capabilities of large water detectors.
In particular, the \lartpc technology is expected to be better suited than water detectors for observing nucleon decays into charged kaons.  For example, in $p \rightarrow \bar{\nu}K^{+}$, the kaon is typically below \cherenkov threshold.  However in a \lartpc detector, the kaon can be identified by its distinctive $dE/dx$ signature as well as by its decay.  Therefore this mode can be tagged in a \lartpc if a single kaon within a proper energy/momentum range can be reconstructed with its point of origin lying within the fiducial volume followed by a known decay mode of the kaon.
Background events initiated by cosmic-ray muons can be controlled  by requiring no activity close to the edges of the TPCs and by stringent single kaon identification within the energy range of interest~\cite{bib:docdb3384,bib:docdb1752}.

Due to the already stringent limits set by \superk on $p \rightarrow e^{+}\pi^0$ and the unique ability to track and identify kaons in a \lartpc, the initial nucleon decay studies in DUNE have focused on nucleon decay modes featuring kaons.  Studies of $p \rightarrow e^{+}\pi^0$ have begun (see Section~\ref{subsec:nonaccel-ndk-other}), but are less sophisticated than the kaon studies.  The remainder of this section describes the background assumptions, signal simulation, particle tracking and identification, and event classification with a focus on nucleon decay via kaons.

\subsubsection{Backgrounds}
\label{sec:ndkbkgd}

The main background for proton decay searches is interactions of  atmospheric neutrinos. In this analysis, the Bartol flux~\cite{Barr:2004br} is used.
%\cite{Bartolref} at Soudan location is used, the Bartol flux is a MC calculation of the atmospheric neutrino fluxes, the calculations starts with simulations of the interactions of the primary cosmic rays with the atmosphere. The earth is assumed to be a sphere and primaries are generated with random positions and angles. The effect of the geomagnetic field on the interacting cosmic rays is included by applying the cutoff using the back-tracing technique \cite{Bartolref} . 
%Fig \ref{fig:atmo_flux} shows the atmospheric flux prediction for different neutrino species.
Neutrino interactions in argon are simulated with the GENIE Neutrino Monte Carlo Generator~\cite{Andreopoulos:2009rq}. To estimate the event rate we integrate the product of the neutrino flux and interaction cross-section.
Table \ref{tab:rate} shows the event rate for different neutrino species for an exposure of 10~kton$\cdot$years.

\begin{dunetable}
[Expected rate of neutrino interactions in $^{40}$Ar for 10~kton-year exposure.]
{cccc}
{tab:rate}
{Expected rate of neutrino interactions in $^{40}$Ar for a 10~kton-year exposure.}
  ~10~kton-years~   &~CC~&~NC~&~Total \\
$\nu_{\mu}$ & 1038 & 398 &1436 \\
$\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ &280 & 169 & 449 \\
$\nu_{e}$ & 597 &  206 &83 \\
$\bar{\nu}_{e}$ & 126 & 72 & 198 \\
Total & 2014 & 845 & 2886 \\
\end{dunetable}

Thus, to suppress atmospheric neutrino background to the level of 1 event per Mton-year, which would yield 0.4 events after ten years of operation with a 40-kton fiducial volume, the rejection factor needed is $3\times 10^{-6}$.

\subsubsection{Kaon Final State Interactions}
\label{sec:final-state-interactions}

The simulation of nucleon decay events is performed using GENIE v.2.12.10. 
A total of 68 single-nucleon exclusive decay channels listed in the 2016 update of the PDG~\cite{Patrignani:2016xqp} is available in GENIE. The list includes two-, three- and five-body decays. 
%The numbering in the decay modes follows the PDG convention. 
%The primary decay is simulated using a phase-space-decay generator. 
%For bound nucleons, the nuclear environment is simulated as in neutrino scattering. 
%The nucleon is assigned a Fermi momentum and removal energy and it is off the mass shell.  
%The relativistic Fermi gas (RFG) nuclear model is used with a Bodek-Ritchie  tail to incorporate short range nucleon-nucleon correlations \cite{Bodek:1981wr}. 
%For $^{40}$Ar the Fermi momentum has a default value of 242.0 MeV/c with binding energy = 27.0 MeV. 
If a bound nucleon decays the remaining nucleus can be in an excited state and will typically de-excite by emitting nuclear fission fragments, nucleons, and photons. At present de-excitation photon emission is simulated only for oxygen~\cite{Andreopoulos:2015wxa}.  However, measurements of argon de-excitation gamma in \lartpc detectors have been reported by the \argoneut collaboration~\cite{Acciarri:2018myr},
where energy depositions and positions of these depositions have been compared to those from simulations of neutrino-argon interactions using the FLUKA Monte Carlo generator.

The propagation of the decay products in the nucleus is simulated using an intra-nuclear cascade Monte Carlo (MC). 
%The probability $\lambda$ that a particle will undergo an interaction is governed by the free cross section $\sigma$ and the density of nucleons $\rho$,
%\begin{equation}
%\lambda(E,r)= \frac{1}{\sigma \rho(r)}.
%\end{equation}
%The type of interaction is then chosen according to the cross sections for various reactions for free nucleons, sometimes modified for nuclear medium effects, relative to the total cross section. 
Charged kaons can undergo various scattering process in the nucleus such as elastic scattering, charge exchange, absorption (only $K^{-}$; $K^{+}$ absorption is forbidden due to baryon number conservation in the nucleus), and $K^{+}$ production via strong processes such as $\pi^{+}n \rightarrow K^{+} \Lambda$.  In this analysis, the $hA2015$ model in GENIE is used as the default model for these final state interactions (FSI).  $hA2015$ is an empirical, data-driven method which does not model the cascade of hadronic interactions step by step, but instead uses one effective interaction where hadron+nucleus data is used to determine the final state.
For kaons, $K^{+}+C$ data~\cite{Bugg:1968zz,Friedman:1997eq}
is used when available. $hA2015$ only considers elastic scattering, and therefore a kaon is never added to or removed from the final state. While there are other FSI models that include the full cascade, there is not enough data to favor one model over the other.  For example, a measurement of kaon production in neutrino interactions shows only a weak preference for including FSI as opposed to a model with no FSI~\cite{Marshall:2016rrn}.

FSI can significantly modify the observable distributions in the detector.  For example, Fig. \ref{fig:K-wFSI-hA2015} shows the kinetic energy of a kaon from $p\rightarrow \bar{\nu}K^{+}$ before and after FSI. Due to FSI the kaon spectrum becomes softer on average. 31.5$\%$ of the kaons undergo elastic scattering resulting in events with very low kinetic energy, with $25\%$ of kaons having a kinetic energy of $\le$50 MeV. When the kaon undergoes elastic scattering, a nucleon can be knocked out of the nucleus. $26.7\%$ of decays via this channel have one neutron coming from FSI, $15.3\%$ have at least one proton, and $10.3\%$ have two protons coming from FSI. These secondary nucleons have a detrimental effect on the reconstruction and selection of $K^{+}$.

\subsubsection{Tracking and particle identification}
\label{sec:event-reconstruction}

The DUNE reconstruction algorithms are described in Chapter~\ref{ch:tools}.  This analysis uses \threed track and vertex reconstruction provided by Projection Matching Algorithm (PMA).

Track reconstruction efficiency for a charged particle $x^{\pm}$ is defined as 

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{x^{\pm}} = \frac{\mbox{$x^{\pm}$ particles with a reconstructed track}}{\mbox{events with $x^{\pm}$ particle }}.
\end{equation}
The denominator includes events in which an $x^{\pm}$ particle was created and has deposited energy within any of the TPCs.  The numerator includes events in which an $x^{\pm}$ particle was created and has deposited energy within any of the TPCs and a reconstructed track can be associated to the $x^{\pm}$ particle based on the number of hits generated by that particle along the track. This efficiency can be calculated as a function of true kinetic energy and true track length.

\begin{dunefigure}[Tracking efficiency of kaons in $p\rightarrow K^{+} \bar{\nu}$]{fig:k-trk-eff}{Tracking efficiency for kaons in simulated proton decay events, $p\rightarrow K^{+} \bar{\nu}$, as a function of kaon kinetic energy (left) and true path length (right).}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{k-trk-eff-KE.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{k-trk-eff-length.pdf}
\end{dunefigure}

Fig. \ref{fig:k-trk-eff} shows the tracking efficiency for $K^{+}$  from proton decay via $p\rightarrow \bar{\nu}K^{+}$ as a function of true kinetic energy and true path length. The overall tracking efficiency for kaons is 58.0$\%$, meaning that 58.0\% of the simulated kaons are associated with a reconstructed track in the detector.  From Fig.\ref{fig:k-trk-eff}, the tracking threshold is approximately $\sim$40~MeV of kinetic energy, which translates to $\sim$4.0~cm in true path length.  The biggest loss in tracking efficiency is due to kaons with $<40$~MeV of kinetic energy due to scattering inside the nucleus as described in Section~\ref{sec:final-state-interactions}.  The efficiency levels off to approximately $80\%$ above 80~MeV of kinetic energy; this inefficiency even at high kinetic energy is due to kaons that decay in flight.
Both kaon scattering in the LAr and charge exchange are included in the simulation, but are relatively small effects (4.6\% of kaons scatter in the LAr and 1.2$\%$ of kaons experience charge exchange).   

%%%%%%%%%%%
%\todo{remove completeness and purity discussion to save space?}
Another useful metric in evaluating tracking performance is the completeness and purity of the track. Completeness is defined as

 \begin{equation}
Completeness = \sum_{i}^{\mbox{track hits}}\frac{\mbox{(hit energy on track from a charged particle)}_{i}}{\mbox{total hit energy from a charged particle}},
\end{equation}
where completeness equal to one means all the hits associated with a charged particle were reconstructed as a single track. 
Fig. \ref{fig:k_complet_purity} (left) shows the track completeness for $K^{+}$ from proton decay events via $p\rightarrow \bar{\nu}K^{+}$. The peak at 0.6 is due to the three-plane design of the TPC.  If a particle travels parallel to a wire plane, it is very likely that the reconstruction algorithm cannot match the \twod clusters of hits in all three views.  This results in a track with a completeness of 2/3 (0.667), with 1/3 of the hits not associated to the track.  This feature has an impact on particle identification since it causes mis-reconstruction of the decay point, where the $dE/dx$ information is most useful.

Track purity is the estimated level of hit contamination from another particle, defined as

\begin{equation}
Purity = \sum_{i}^{\mbox{track hits}}\frac{\mbox{(hit energy on track from a charged particle)}_{i}}{\mbox{total hit energy on the track}},
\end{equation}

Fig \ref{fig:k_complet_purity} (right) shows the track purity for $K^{+}$ from proton decay events via $p\rightarrow \bar{\nu}K^{+}$. The average purity for a kaon track is $\sim0.94$. 
%Of the 
16$\%$ of kaon tracks have lower purity than average; in most cases this is due to a proton and kaon overlapping in a single track. This will also impact the performance of the particle identification since the information on $dE/dx$ is misleading due to overlap of a different particle. 

\begin{dunefigure}[Completeness and purity of kaon tracks in $p\rightarrow K^{+} \bar{\nu}$]{fig:k_complet_purity}{Completeness (left) and purity (right) for kaon tracks in simulated proton decay events, $p\rightarrow K^{+} \bar{\nu}$.}

\end{dunefigure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Charged particles lose energy through ionization and scintillation when traversing the LAr, and this energy loss provides valuable information on particle energy and species. To identify a given particle, the hits associated with a reconstructed track are used.
The total energy deposition from the track is obtained by summing the $dE/dx$ for all the reconstructed hits. 
If the charged particle stops in the \lartpc active volume, a combination of $dE/dx$ and the reconstructed residual range ($R$, the path length to the end point of the track), is used to define a parameter for particle identification.  The parameter, PIDA, is defined as  

\begin{equation}
\textnormal{PIDA} = \left\langle \left(\frac{dE}{dx}\right)_{i}R^{0.42}_{i}\right\rangle,\label{eqn:PIDA}
\end{equation}
where the median is taken over all track points $i$ for which the residual range $R_i$ is less than 30~cm.
%This procedure can be done for each plane. 

\begin{dunefigure}[Particle identification for $p\rightarrow K^{+} \bar{\nu}$]{fig:PIDA}{Particle identification (PIDA) for particles in simulated proton decay events, $p\rightarrow K^{+} \bar{\nu}$.}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{PIDA.pdf}
\end{dunefigure}

Fig \ref{fig:PIDA} shows the PIDA performance for kaons (from proton decay), muons (from kaon decay) and protons produced by atmospheric neutrino interactions. The tail with lower values in each distribution is due to cases where the decay/stopping point was missed by the track reconstruction. The tail with higher values is caused when a second particle overlaps at the decay/stopping point causing higher values of $dE/dx$ and resulting in higher values of PIDA. In addition, ionization fluctuations smear out these distributions.

A complication for particle identification via $dE/dx$ results when there is ambiguity in reconstructing track direction, which is made more problematic when considering that there may be additional energy deposition at the originating point in events where FSI is significant.  The dominant background to $p\rightarrow \bar{\nu} K^{+}$ in DUNE is atmospheric neutrino charged-current quasi-elastic (CCQE) scattering, $\nu_{\mu} n \rightarrow \mu^{-} p$.  When the muon happens to have very close
to the 237~MeV/c momentum expected from a $K^{+}$ decay at rest and does not capture, it is indistinguishable from the muon resulting from $p\rightarrow \bar{\nu} K^{+}$ followed by $K^{+} \rightarrow \mu^{+}\nu_{\mu}$. When
the proton is additionally mis-reconstructed as a kaon, this background mimics the signal process.  

The most important difference between signal and this background source is the direction of the hadron track. In the atmospheric neutrino case, the proton and muon originate from the same neutrino interaction point, and the characteristic Bragg rise occurs at the end of the proton track farthest from the muon-proton vertex. In signal, the kaon-muon vertex is where the $K^{+}$ stops and decays at rest, so its ionization energy deposit is highest near the kaon-muon vertex.  To take advantage of this difference, a log-likelihood ratio discriminator is used to distinguish signal from background.  Templates are formed by taking the reconstructed calibrated energy deposit as a function of the number of wires from both the start and end of the $K^{+}$ candidate hadron track. 
%The best view is used, which is typically the collection plane. 
Two log-likelihood ratios are computed separately for each track. The first begins at the hadron-muon shared vertex and moves along the hadron track. The second begins at the other end of the track, furthest from the hadron-muon shared vertex. For signal events, this effectively looks for the absence of a Bragg rise at the $K^{+}$ start, and the presence of one at the end, and vice versa for background.  At each point, the probability density for signal and background, $P^{sig}$ and $P^{bkg}$, are determined from the templates. Forward and backward log-likelihood ratios are computed as

\begin{align}
 \mathcal{L}_{fwd/bkwd} = \sum_i \log\frac{P^{sig}_i}{P^{bkg}_i}, 
\end{align}
where the summation is over the wires of the track. The discriminator is the sum of the forward and backward log-likelihood ratios,

\begin{align}
    \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{fwd} + \mathcal{L}_{bkwd}.\label{eqn:L}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Event Classification}

Multivariate classification methods based on machine learning techniques have become a fundamental ingredient to most analyses in high-energy physics. 
To develop an event selection to search for nucleon decay, a boosted decision tree (BDT) classifier is used. The software package Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis with ROOT (TMVA4)~\cite{Hocker:2007ht}
was used with AdaBoost as the boosted algorithm.  In the analyses presented here, the BDT is trained on a sample of MC events (50k events for signal and background) that is statistically independent from the sample of MC events used in the analysis (100k events for signal and 600k events for background.)

As an independent method of identifying nucleon decay events, image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be performed using \twod images of DUNE MC events. The image classification provides a single score value as a metric of whether any given event is consistent with a proton decay, and this score can be used as a powerful discriminant for event identification.

\subsection{Sensitivity to $p\to K^+\bar{\nu}$ decay}
\label{subsec:nonaccel-ndk-nubarkplus}

Monte Carlo studies of the $p\to K^+ \bar{\nu}$ signal and corresponding atmospheric neutrino backgrounds have been carried out with the DUNE multi-purpose full event simulation and reconstruction software.  As indicated in the previous section, they reveal that the main challenge in identifying proton decay candidates is due to backgrounds arising from the mis-reconstruction of protons as positive kaons. This happens when a charged current (CC) neutrino interaction produces a muon and a recoiling proton, and the primary vertex for neutrino interaction is mis-labeled as a secondary vertex where the kaon decays.  Complicating the ability to reject pathological events of this type is the presence of FSI, which can shift the spectrum of kaons towards low energies, with possible concurrent emission of nucleons, which together weaken the otherwise distinct energy and $dE/dx$ signature of the kaon. 

The branching fraction for leptonic decay of charged kaons, $K\rightarrow \mu \nu_{\mu}$, is approximately 64$\%$. The remaining decay modes are semileptonic or hadronic and include charged and neutral pions. The leptonic decay offers a distinguishable topology with a heavy ionizing particle followed by a minimum ionizing particle. In addition, given the kinematics of a proton decay event, 92.0$\%$ of the kaons decay at rest. Using two-body kinematics, the momentum of the muon is approximately 237 MeV/$c$. The reconstructed momentum of the muon offers a powerful discriminating variable to separate signal from background events.  This analysis includes all modes of kaon decay, but the selection strategy so far has focused on kaon decay to muons.

The proton decay signal and atmospheric neutrino background events are processed through the same reconstruction chain and subject to the same selection criteria. A pre-selection is applied to remove obvious background. The pre-selection cuts require at least two tracks in the event and that the longest track is not greater than 100 cm in length. After these cuts, 50$\%$ of the signal and 17.5$\%$ of the background remain in the sample.

A CNN was developed to classify signal and background events which gives 99.9\% background rejection at 6\% signal efficiency.  Better discriminating power is achieved using a BDT with 14 input variables, including the CNN score as one of the variables.  The other variables in the BDT include numbers of reconstructed objects (tracks, showers, vertices), variables related to visible energy deposition, particle identification variables (PIDA, Equation~\ref{eqn:PIDA}, and $\mathcal{L}$, Equation~\ref{eqn:L}), reconstructed track length, and reconstructed momentum.
%Including the CNN score in the BDT analysis gives a 40\% background reduction.
Figure \ref{fig:BDT_response} shows the distribution of the BDT output for signal and background.

\begin{dunefigure}
[BDT response for $p\rightarrow K^{+} \bar{\nu}$ ]{fig:BDT_response}
{BDT response for $p\rightarrow K^{+} \bar{\nu}$ for signal (blue) and background (red)}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{BDT_response.pdf}
\end{dunefigure} 

%Figure~\ref{fig:BDT_eff} shows the efficiency of the BDT selection for pre-selected signal and background events, where the efficiency is defined as the fraction of true signal or background events remaining in the simulated sample after the cut. The total efficiency can be calculated by multiplying the pre-selection efficiency by the BDT efficiency.  (For example, for a BDT signal efficiency of 30\%, the background BDT efficiency is $\sim 10^{-5}\%$.  The overall efficiency is $15\% = 30\% \times 50\%$ for signal and $\sim10^{-6} \% = 17.5\% \times \sim 10^{-5}\%$ for background, equivalent to $\sim$1 background event per Mton-year.)

Figure~\ref{fig:event_signal} shows a signal event with high BDT response value (0.615), meaning a well-classified event. The event display shows the reconstructed kaon track in green, the reconstructed muon track from the kaon decay in maroon, and the reconstructed shower from the Michel electron coming from the muon decay in red. Figure~\ref{fig:event_bkgd} shows event displays for background events.  The left figure (BDT response value of 0.394) shows the interaction of an atmospheric electron neutrino, $\nu_{e}+n\rightarrow e^{-}+p+\pi^{0}$. The right figure (BDT response value 0.587) shows a CCQE interaction of an atmospheric muon neutrino, $\nu_{\mu}+n \rightarrow \mu^{-}+p$. The interaction on the right can represent a challenge if the proton track is misidentified as kaon. A tight cut on BDT response can remove most of these events, but this results in a significant reduction in the signal efficiency.

\end{dunefigure}

The optimal lifetime sensitivity is achieved by combining the pre-selection cuts with a BDT cut that gives a signal efficiency of 0.15 and a background efficiency of $3\times 10^{-6}$, which corresponds to approximately 1 background event per Mton-year. Assuming no signal is observed over 10 years of running with a total of 40~kton of fiducial mass, a 90$\%$ CL upper limit on the proton lifetime in this channel of $6.6\times10^{33}$~years can be set. This calculation assumes constant signal and background efficiency over time and for each of the far detector modules.  Additional running improves the sensitivity proportionately provided the experiment remains background-free.

The dominant systematic uncertainty in the signal is expected to be related to the kaon FSI. To account for this uncertainty, kaon elastic scattering ($K^{+}p(n)\rightarrow K^{+}p(n)$) is re-weighted by $\pm 50\%$ in the simulation. The spread in the signal efficiency with this re-weighting is $(15\pm 2)\%$, which is taken as the  systematic uncertainty on the signal efficiency.
The dominant uncertainty in the background 
is due to the absolute normalization of the atmospheric neutrino rate. The Bartol group has carried out a detailed study of the systematic uncertainties, where the absolute neutrino fluxes are found to have uncertainties of around 15$\%$~\cite{Barr:2006it}.
The remaining uncertainties are due to the cross section models for neutrino interactions. Uncertainty in the total $\nu$ CC cross section peaks at 8$\%$ in the 1-5 GeV region~\cite{Adamson:2012gt}.
Based on these two effects, a conservative 20$\%$ systematic uncertainty in the background is considered.
%Finally a 0.1$\%$ uncertainty in the calculation of the fiducial volume is proposed. 

The limiting factor in the sensitivity is the kaon tracking efficiency.  With the current reconstruction, the tracking efficiency for kaons plateaus at around 80\% for high-energy kaons.  However, after FSI, many kaons have energy less than 40 MeV, below the tracking threshold, leading to an overall tracking efficiency of 58\%.
Studies show that if all kaons with a path length of 2~cm or longer could be tracked (excluding kaons that decay in flight), the tracking efficiency could improve to approximately 80\%.  Combining this tracking performance improvement with some improvement in the $K/p$ separation performance for short tracks, the overall signal selection efficiency could improve from 15\% to around 30\%.  This would improve the sensitivity by about a factor of two.  

\subsection{Sensitivity to other key nucleon decay modes}
\label{subsec:nonaccel-ndk-other}

Another potential mode for a baryon number violation search is the decay of the neutron into a charged lepton plus meson, i.e.~$n\rightarrow e^{-}K^{+}$. The current best limit on this mode is $3.2\times 10^{31}$~years from the FREJUS collaboration~\cite{Berger:1991fa}. The reconstruction software for this analysis is the same as for the $p\rightarrow \bar{\nu} K^{+} $ analysis; the analysis again uses a BDT that includes image classification (CNN) score as an input. To calculate the lifetime sensitivity for this decay mode the same systematic uncertainties and procedure is used. The final selection efficiency for this channel is 0.23, with a background efficiency of 5$\times 10^{-5}$, which corresponds to 15 background events per Mton-year. The lifetime sensitivity for a 400~kton$\cdot$year exposure is 5.4$\times 10^{33}$~years. As in the $p\rightarrow \bar{\mu}K^{+}$ analysis, there are challenges that come from kaon FSI and reconstruction; improvements in tracking and particle identification could improve the efficiency and thus the lifetime sensitivity by approximately a factor of two.  Nevertheless, with the current reconstruction and analysis tools, the DUNE FD technology can improve the lifetime limit for this particular channel by two orders of magnitude.

The sensitivity to the $p \rightarrow e^{+} \pi^0$ mode has also been calculated. For this analysis, reconstruction is not applied, and true quantities are used as inputs to a BDT to isolate events that contain a positron and two photons from the $\pi^0$ decay.  Energy smearing is applied to simulate the effects of reconstruction.  Applying the same selection to the atmospheric neutrino background and calculating the limit yields a sensitivity for an exposure of 800~kton-years in the range of $1.2 \times 10^{34}$ to $1.5 \times 10^{34}$~years depending on the level of energy smearing (in the range 5-30\%).  This analysis is preliminary, but it indicates that DUNE could achieve a sensitivity comparable to \superk's current limit of $1.6 \times 10^{34}$~years~\cite{Miura:2016krn}.

\subsection{Detector requirements for nucleon decay searches}
\label{subsec:nonaccel-ndk-requirements}

As is the case for the entire non-accelerator based physics program of DUNE, nucleon decay 
searches require efficient triggering and event localization (within the far detector) 
capabilities. The photon detection system must be able to provide the time of each event ($T0$) in order to reject cosmics. Given the 1~GeV energy release, the requirements on tracking and calorimetry 
capabilities are similar to those for the beam-based neutrino oscillation program described 
in Chapter~\ref{ch:osc}.
Experimental challenges such as particle identification to separate protons from kaons, 
the impact of FSI on proton decay kinematics, and full control
of the potential background processes, are presently under study with realistic detector simulations.
This includes opportunities for enhanced background rejection 
by using convolutional neural networks, as well as efforts to understand the
uncertainty associated with the intra-nuclear cascade model used to simulate FSI. 
%Especially critical is the exquisite $dE/dx$ resolution offered by the \lartpc response. 
We expect that \dword{protodune} data taken with charged particle beams at CERN will 
provide important sample of events to train and improve on reconstruction algorithms 
and the resulting $dE/dx$ resolution.

\subsection{Nucleon Decay Summary}
\label{sec:ndksummary}

In summary, an analysis of DUNE's sensitivity to proton decay via $p\rightarrow K^{+} \bar{\nu}$ with full simulation and reconstruction shows that the sensitivity after a 400~kton$\cdot$years exposure
is comparable to the current limit from \superk based on an exposure of 260~kton$\cdot$years.  Previous estimates of the sensitivity in this channel in a \lartpc~\cite{Acciarri:2015uup} did not consider kaon FSI and were overly optimistic about the kaon tracking efficiency, assuming a nearly perfect signal detection efficiency.  An analysis of the sensitivity to neutron decay via $n\rightarrow e^{-}K^{+}$ has also been completed; DUNE could improve the lifetime limits in this mode by two orders of magnitude.  Future studies on nucleon decay into kaons will focus on potential improvements in track reconstruction, improved methods of particle and event identification, and understanding kaon FSI models.  Studies indicate improvements in these areas could increase the sensitivity to the above modes by a factor of two. Figure~\ref{fig:sens} summarizes the sensitivity of the two kaon modes studied so far. Analysis of other modes of proton decay into kaons is underway, as well as the first investigations of the $p \rightarrow e^{+}\pi^0$ with full simulation and reconstruction.

\section{N-Nbar oscillations}
\label{sec:nonaccel-nnbar}

\subsection{Motivation for $\Delta$B=2 physics and possible experimental approaches}
\label{subsec:nonaccel-nnbar-intro}

Neutron-antineutron ($n - \bar{n}$) oscillation is a baryon number violating process that
has never been observed but is predicted by a number of Beyond Standard Model
theories~\cite{Phillips:2014fgb}. In this context, baryon number conservation is considered an accidental
symmetry rather than a fundamental one, which means baryon number violation
does not stand against the fundamental gauge symmetries. Discovery of baryon
number violation would have implications about the source of matter-antimatter
symmetry in our universe, per Sakharov's conditions for such asymmetry to arise~\cite{Sakharov:1967dj}.
The neutron-antineutron oscillation ($n-\bar{n}$ or n-nbar) process in particular violates
baryon number by two units, and therefore could also have further implications on
the smallness of neutrino masses~\cite{Phillips:2014fgb}. The $n - \bar{n}$ process is one of many possible baryon number violating processes that DUNE can search for. Searches for this process with
both free neutrons and nucleus-bound neutron states have been continued efforts
since 1980s. The current best 90\% C.L. limits on the (free) neutron oscillation
lifetime from free and nucleus-bound n-nbar searches are $8.6\times10^7$~s and $2.7\times 10^8$~s, respectively~\cite{BaldoCeolin:1994jz,Abe:2011ky}.

Neutron-antineutron oscillations can be detected via the subsequent antineutron annihilation with a neutron or a proton. Table~\ref{tab:nnbar-br} shows the branching ratios for the antineutron annihilation modes applicable to intranuclear searches.  This annihilation event will have a distinct signature of a vertex with several emitted light hadrons, with total energy of twice the nucleon mass and zero net momentum. The ability to reconstruct these hadrons correctly and measure their energies is key to the identification of the signal event. The main background for these $n - \bar{n}$ annihilation events is caused by atmospheric neutrinos. Most commonly mis-classified events are neutral current deep inelastic scattering events without a lepton in the final state. As with nucleon decay, nuclear effects and final state interactions make the picture more complicated.

\subsection{Sensitivity to intranuclear neutron-antineutron oscillations in DUNE}
\label{subsec:nonaccel-nnbar-dunesensitivity}

The simulation of this process has been developed~\cite{Hewes:2017xtr} and was implemented in GENIE as of version v.2.12. The implementation of this process in GENIE makes use of GENIE's existing modeling of Fermi momentum and binding energy for both the oscillating neutron and the nucleon with which the resulting antineutron annihilates.   Once a neutron has oscillated to an antineutron in a nucleus, the antineutron has a 18/39 chance of annihilating with a proton in argon, and a 21/39 chance of annihilating with a neutron. The energies and momenta of the annihilation products are assigned randomly but consistently with four-momentum conservation. The products of the annihilation process follow the branching fractions (shown in Table~\ref{tab:nnbar-br}) measured in low-energy antiproton annihilation on hydrogen.
%, biased as necessary by conservation of total available energy in the annihilation \textcolor{red}{the last part is not clear}. 
Since the annihilation products are produced inside the nucleus, GENIE further models the re-interactions of those products as they propagate in the nucleus (until they escape the nucleus).  The FSI are simulated using the $hA2015$ model in GENIE as described in Section~\ref{sec:final-state-interactions}.

Figure \ref{fig:pi_FSI_m} shows the momentum distributions for charged and neutral pions before FSI and after FSI. From these distributions, it can be seen that the FSI make both charged and neutral pions less energetic.  The effect of FSI on pion multiplicity is also rather significant; 0.9$\%$ of the events have no charged pions before FSI, whereas after FSI 11.1$\%$ of the events have no charged pions. For the neutral pion case, 11.0 $\%$ of the events have no neutral pions before FSI, whereas after FSI 23.4$\%$ of the events have no neutral pions. The decrease in pion multiplicity is primarily due to pion absorption in the nucleus. Another effect from FSI is nucleon knockout from pion elastic scattering. 94$\%$ of the events have at least one proton from FSI and 95$\%$ of the events have at least one neutron from FSI. Although the kinetic energy for these nucleons peak at a few tens of MeV, the kinetic energy can be as large as hundreds of MeV.  In summary, the effects of FSI in $n-\bar{n}$ become relevant since they modify the kinematics and topology of the event. For instance, even though the decay modes of Table \ref{tab:nnbar-br} do not include nucleons in their decay products, nucleons appear with a high probability after FSI.

\begin{dunefigure}

The main background process in search of bound $n-\bar{n}$ oscillation in DUNE is assumed to be the atmospheric neutrino interaction in the detector.  This is simulated in GENIE as described in Section~\ref{sec:ndkbkgd}.

As with the $p\rightarrow K^{+} \bar{\nu}$ analysis, two distinct methods of reconstruction and event selection have been applied for this search. One involves traditional reconstruction methods (\threed track and vertex reconstruction by PMA); the other involves image classification 
%on TPC \twod projections of TPC collection plane wires vs. drift distance (CNN). 
of 2D images of reconstructed hits. The two methods are combined in the form of a multivariate analysis which combines the image classification score with other physical observables extracted from traditional reconstruction.  A boosted decision tree (BDT) classifier is used. A total of 10 variables are used in the BDT event selection, including number of reconstructed tracks and showers, variables related to visible energy deposition, particle identification variables (PIDA and $dE/dx$), reconstructed momentum, and CNN score.  Figure~\ref{fig:bdt_nnbar} shows the distribution of the BDT output for signal and background.

Figure \ref{fig:nnbar_sig} shows a $n-\bar{n}$ event with high BDT response value (0.592). Showers from neutral pions are shown in red, blue, yellow and green. The reconstructed charged pion tracks are shown as green and maroon lines. The topology of this event is consistent with multiple charged pion production and neutral pion production. 

The left side plot in Fig. \ref{fig:nnbar_bkgd} shows a neutral current background event $\nu_{e}+n\rightarrow \nu_{e}+p+p$ with low BDT response value (0.388). The two protons from the NC interaction are reconstructed as tracks, and no shower activity is present. The right side plot in Fig. \ref{fig:nnbar_bkgd} displays a charged current background event $\nu_{e}+n\rightarrow {e}^{-}+p+\pi +p$ with high BDT response value (0.598). This background events mimics the signal topology by having multi-particle production and also an electromagnetic shower. Further improvements in shower reconstruction, especially $dE/dx$, should help to classify these type of background events in the future, since the electron shower $dE/dx$ is different from the $dE/dx$ of two showers induced by gamma-rays from a neutral pion decay.

The sensitivity to the $n-\bar{n}$ oscillation lifetime can be calculated for a given exposure, the efficiency of selecting signal events, and the background rate along their uncertainties. The lifetime sensitivity is obtained at 90\% confidence level for the bound neutron. Then, the lifetime sensitivity for a free neutron is acquired using the conversion from nucleus bounded neutron to free neutron $n-\bar{n}$ oscillation~\cite{Friedman:2008es}.  The preliminary systematic uncertainties on exposure (3\%), signal and background efficiency (25\%) are taken from the $n-\bar{n}$ oscillation search by the \superk collaboration~\cite{Abe:2011ky}.

The free $n-\bar{n}$ oscillation lifetime, $\tau_{n-\bar{n}}$, and bounded $n-\bar{n}$ oscillation lifetime, $T_{n-\bar{n}}$, are related to each other through the suppression factor $R$ as

\begin{equation}
    \tau^{2}_{n-\bar{n}} = \frac{T_{n-\bar{n}}}{R} ~.
    \label{eq:tau}
\end{equation}
The suppression factor $R$ varies for different nuclei. The calculation of this suppression factor was done for $^{16}$O and $^{56}$Fe~\cite{Friedman:2008es}. The $R$ for $^{56}$Fe, $0.666\times10^{23}$ $s^{-1}$, is used in this analysis for $^{40}$Ar nuclei.

The best bound neutron lifetime limit is achieved using a signal efficiency of 8.0$\%$ at the background rejection probability of 99.98$\%$. The 90$\%$ C.L. limit of a bound neutron lifetime is 6.45$\times 10^{32}$ years for a 400~kton-year exposure. The corresponding  limit for the oscillation time of free neutrons is calculated to be 5.53$\times 10^{8}$~s. This is about a factor of two improvement from the current best limit \cite{Abe:2011ky}.  Planned future improvements to this analysis include improved CNN performance and better estimates of systematic uncertainties.

\section{Physics with atmospheric neutrinos}
\label{sec:nonaccel-atm}

Atmospheric neutrinos are a unique tool to study neutrino oscillations: the oscillated flux contains all flavors of neutrinos and antineutrinos, is very sensitive to matter effects and to both $\Delta m^2$ parameters, and covers a wide range of $L/E$. In principle, all oscillation parameters could be measured, with high
complementarity to measurements performed with a neutrino beam. In addition, atmospheric neutrinos are available all the time, in particular before the beam becomes operational. The DUNE far detector, with its large mass and the overburden to protect it from atmospheric muon background, is an ideal tool for these studies.  Given the strong overlap in event topology and energy scale with beam neutrino interactions, most requirements will necessarily be met by the far detector design. Additional requirements include the need to self-trigger since atmospheric neutrino events are asynchronous with respect to accelerator timing, and a more stringent demand on neutrino direction reconstruction.

\subsection{Oscillation physics with atmospheric neutrinos}
\label{sec:nonaccel-atm-oscillations}

The sensitivity to oscillation parameters with atmospheric neutrinos in DUNE has been evaluated.
%with a 
%dedicated simulation, reconstruction and analysis chain. 
The fluxes of each neutrino species were computed at the far detector location, after 
oscillation. Interactions in the LAr medium were simulated with the GENIE event 
generator. Detection thresholds and energy resolutions based on full 
simulations were applied to the outgoing particles, to take into account 
detector effects. Events were classified as Fully Contained (FC) or 
Partially Contained (PC) by placing the vertex at a random position inside the 
detector and tracking the lepton until it reached the edge of the detector. %its edges.  
Partially Contained events 
are those where a final state muon exits the detector.  The number of events expected 
for each flavor and category is summarized in Table~\ref{tab:atmos_rates}.

Figure~\ref{fig:lovere} shows the expected $L/E$ distribution for high-resolution, muon-like 
events from a \SI{350}{\ktyr} exposure. The data provide excellent resolution of the 
first two oscillation nodes, even when taking into account the expected statistical uncertainty.
In performing oscillation fits, the data in each flavor/containment category are 
binned in energy and zenith angle.

\end{dunefigure}

When neutrinos travel through the Earth, the MSW resonance influences 
electron neutrinos in the few-GeV energy range. More precisely, the resonance 
occurs for $\nu_e$ in the case of normal mass hierarchy (NH, $\Delta m^2_{32} > 0$), and for 
$\overline{\nu}_e$ in the case of inverted mass hierarchy (IH, $\Delta m^2_{32} < 0$).

The mass hierarchy (MH) sensitivity can be greatly enhanced if neutrino and antineutrino events can be 
separated. The DUNE detector will not be magnetized; however, its high-resolution 
imaging offers possibilities for tagging features of events that provide statistical 
discrimination between neutrinos and antineutrinos. For the sensitivity calculations 
%that follow, 
two such tags were included: a proton tag and a decay electron tag. 

Figure~\ref{fig:atm_mh} shows the MH sensitivity as a function of the fiducial exposure. 
Over this range of fiducial exposures, the sensitivity goes essentially as the square 
root of the exposure, indicating that the measurement is not systematics-limited. 
Unlike for beam measurements, the sensitivity to MH with atmospheric neutrinos is 
nearly independent of the CP-violating phase.  The sensitivity comes from both 
electron neutrino appearance as well as muon neutrino disappearance, and is strongly 
dependent on the true value of $\theta_{23}$, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:atm_mh}.  Despite the
much smaller mass, DUNE would have comparable sensitivity to Hyper-Kamiokande regarding atmospheric 
neutrino analyses~\cite{Kearns:2013lea} due to the higher detector resolution.

\begin{dunefigure}
[MH Sensitivity vs. Exposure for Atmospheric Neutrinos]{fig:atm_mh}
{Sensitivity to mass hierarchy using atmospheric neutrinos as a function of fiducial exposure in a liquid argon detector (left), and as a function of the true value of $\theta_{23}$ (right).  For comparison, Hyper-K sensitivities are also shown \cite{Kearns:2013lea}.}
\includegraphics[width=0.42\linewidth]{atm_mh_vs_exposure.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.48\linewidth]{combined_sensitivity_hierarchy_lbne_vs_hyperk.pdf}
\end{dunefigure}

In the two-flavor approximation, neutrino oscillation probabilities depend on 
$\sin^2(2\theta)$, which is invariant when changing $\theta$ to $\pi/2-\theta$. In this case, the octant 
degeneracy remains for $\theta_{23}$ in the leading order terms of the full 
three-flavor oscillation probability, making it impossible to determine whether $\theta_{23}< \pi/4$ or 
$\theta_{23}> \pi/4$. Accessing full three-flavor oscillation with atmospheric neutrinos 
will provide a handle for solving the ambiguity.


These analyses will provide an approach complementary to that of beam neutrinos. 
% Atmospheric neutrinos  can help to lift
For instance, they should enable resolution of 
degeneracies that can be present in beam analyses, since % through the fact that 
the MH sensitivity is essentially independent of $\delta_{CP}$.   Atmospheric neutrino data will be acquired 
even in the absence of the beam, and will provide a useful sample for the development of 
reconstruction software, analysis methodologies, and calibrations.  
Atmospheric neutrinos provide a window into a range of new physics scenarios, and %can 
may allow DUNE to place limits on Lorentz and CPT violation (see Section~\ref{sec:nonaccel-atm-bsm}), 
non-standard interactions~\cite{Chatterjee:2014gxa}, mass-varying neutrinos~\cite{Abe:2008zza}, and
sterile neutrinos~\cite{Abe:2014gda}.

\subsection{BSM physics with atmospheric neutrinos}
\label{sec:nonaccel-atm-bsm}

Studying DUNE atmospheric neutrinos is a promising approach
to searching for Lorentz and CPT violation,
which has been hypothesized
to emerge from an underlying Planck-scale theory such as strings~\cite{Kostelecky:1988zi,Kostelecky:1991ak}.
The comprehensive realistic effective field theory
for Lorentz and CPT violation,
the Standard-Model Extension (SME)~\cite{Kostelecky:1994rn,Colladay:1996iz,Colladay:1998fq,Kostelecky:2003fs},
is a powerful and calculable framework
for the analysis of experimental data.
All SME coefficients for Lorentz and CPT violation
governing the propagation and oscillation of neutrinos
have been enumerated~\cite{Kostelecky:2003cr,Kostelecky:2011gq},
and many experimental measurements of SME coefficients 
have been performed to date~\cite{Kostelecky:2008ts}.
Nonetheless,
much of the available SME coefficient space 
in the neutrino sector remains unexplored.

Experimental signals predicted by the SME include
corrections to standard neutrino-neutrino 
and antineutrino-antineutrino mixing probabilities,
oscillations between neutrinos and antineutrinos,
and modifications of oscillation-free propagation,
all of which incorporate unconventional dependencies
on the magnitudes and directions of momenta and spin.
For DUNE atmospheric neutrinos,
the long available baselines,
the comparatively high energies accessible,
and the broad range of momentum directions
offer major advantages that can make possible 
improvements of several orders of magnitude
in sensitivities to certain types of Lorentz and CPT violation~\cite{Kostelecky:2003cr,Kostelecky:2011gq,Kostelecky:2003xn,Kostelecky:2004hg,Diaz:2009qk,Diaz:2013saa,Diaz:2013wia}.
To date,
%three 
experimental searches for Lorentz and CPT violation
with atmospheric neutrinos have been published 
by the IceCube and \superk collaborations~\cite{Abbasi:2010kx,Abe:2014wla,Aartsen:2017ibm}.
Similar studies are possible with DUNE,
and many SME coefficients can be measured that remain unconstrained to date.
%Other prospects of interest include limits from Cherenkov processes
%at long baselines and high energies~\cite{Kostelecky:2011gq}.
%Significant contributions to the search 
%for Lorentz and CPT violation may also 
%come from studies of cosmological neutrinos
%once more is understood about their nature,
%as these offer an extreme baseline
%and correspondingly striking sensitivities
%to SME coefficients~\cite{Diaz:2013wia}.

An example of the potential reach of studies with DUNE atmospheric neutrinos
is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:atm},
which displays estimated sensitivities
from DUNE atmospheric neutrinos to a subset of coefficients 
controlling isotropic (rotation-invariant) violations 
in the Sun-centered frame~\cite{Kostelecky:2002hh}.
The experimental sensitivities to these effects
are set primarily by the baseline and the maximum detectable energy.
DUNE can achieve first measurements (red) on some coefficients
and improved measurements (green) on others.
Gray bars show existing limits.

To illustrate an SME modification of oscillation probabilities,
consider a measurement of the atmospheric neutrino and antineutrino flux
as a function of energy.
For definiteness,
we adopt atmospheric neutrino fluxes~\cite{Honda:2015fha}
evaluated using the NRLMSISE-00 global atmospheric model~\cite{Picone}
that result from a production event at an altitude of 20 km.
Assuming conventional oscillations with standard mass-matrix values from the PDG~\cite{Tanabashi:2018oca},
the fluxes at the detector are shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:atm2}.
The sum of the $\nu_e$ and $\overline\nu_e$ fluxes
is shown as a function of energy as a red dashed line, 
while the sum of the $\nu_\mu$ and $\overline\nu_\mu$ fluxes 
as a blue dashed line. 
Adding an isotropic non-minimal coefficient for Lorentz violation
of magnitude $\mathaccent'27 c^{(6)}_{e \mu} = 10^{-28}$ GeV$^{-2}$
%\fixme{expression with coeff 6 e/mu = ... causes error. Anne  Fixed - Lisa}
changes the fluxes from the dashed lines to the solid ones.
This coefficient is many orders of magnitude smaller
than the current experimental limit.
Nonetheless,
the flux spectrum is predicted to change significantly 
at energies above about 100 GeV.
