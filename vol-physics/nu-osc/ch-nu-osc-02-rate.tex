The oscillation probability of \numu $\rightarrow$ \nue through matter in a constant density
approximation is,  % Anne 3/9
to first order~\cite{Nunokawa:2007qh}:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
P(\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e) & \simeq & \sin^2 \theta_{23} \sin^2 2 \theta_{13} 
\frac{ \sin^2(\Delta_{31} - aL)}{(\Delta_{31}-aL)^2} \Delta_{31}^2\\ \nonumber
& & + \sin 2 \theta_{23} \sin 2 \theta_{13} \sin 2 \theta_{12} \frac{ \sin(\Delta_{31} - aL)}{(\Delta_{31}-aL)} \Delta_{31} \frac{\sin(aL)}{(aL)} \Delta_{21} \cos (\Delta_{31} + \mdeltacp)\\ \nonumber
& & + \cos^2 \theta_{23} \sin^2 2 \theta_{12} \frac {\sin^2(aL)}{(aL)^2} \Delta_{21}^2, \\ \nonumber
\label{eqn:appprob}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Delta_{ij} = \Delta m^2_{ij} L/4E_\nu$, $a = G_FN_e/\sqrt{2}$, $G_F$ is the Fermi constant, $N_e$ is the number density of electrons in the Earth, $L$ is the baseline in km, and $E_\nu$ is the neutrino energy in GeV. 
In the equation above, both \deltacp and $a$ 
switch signs in going from the
$\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ to the $\bar{\nu}_\mu \to \bar{\nu}_e$ channel; i.e.,
a neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry is introduced both by \dword{cpv} (\deltacp)
and the matter effect ($a$). The origin of the matter effect asymmetry 
is simply the presence of electrons and absence of positrons in the Earth.  
In the few-GeV energy range, the asymmetry from the matter effect increases with baseline as the neutrinos
pass through more matter; therefore an experiment with a longer baseline will be
more sensitive to the neutrino mass ordering. For baselines longer than 
$\sim$\SI{1200}\km, the degeneracy between the asymmetries from matter
and \dword{cpv} effects can be resolved~\cite{Bass:2013vcg}. \dword{dune}, with a baseline of $\sim$\SI{1300}\km, 
will be able to unambiguously
determine the neutrino mass ordering \textit{and} measure the value of \deltacp~\cite{Diwan:2004bt}. 

The electron neutrino appearance probability, $P(\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e)$, 
is shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:oscprob} at a baseline of \SI{1300}\km{} as a function of neutrino 
energy for several values of \deltacp. As this figure illustrates, the value 
of \deltacp affects both the amplitude and frequency of
the oscillation. The difference in probability amplitude
for different values of \deltacp is larger at higher oscillation nodes, which 
correspond to energies less than 1.5~GeV. Therefore, a broadband experiment, 
capable of measuring not only the rate of \nue appearance but of mapping out the 
spectrum of observed oscillations down to energies of at least 500~MeV, 
is desirable~\cite{Diwan:2003bp}. Since the sign of  \deltacp changes in going from neutrinos to antineutrinos in Equation~\ref{eqn:appprob},
changes to the value of \deltacp induce opposite effects on \nue and
\anue appearance probabilities, so a beam that is capable of operating in
neutrino mode (forward horn current) and antineutrino-enhanced mode (reverse horn current)
is also a critical component of the experiment.

  (right), for normal ordering. The black line indicates the oscillation
  probability if $\theta_{13}$ were equal to zero.}

The experimental sensitivities presented here are estimated using the methods described in Section~\ref{sec:physics-lbnosc-sens}. This document presents physics sensitivities using the optimized design of the 1.2~MW neutrino beam and corresponding protons-on-target per year assumed to be 1.1 $\times 10^{21}$ POT.  These numbers assume a combined uptime and efficiency of the \dword{fnal} accelerator complex and the \dword{lbnf} beamline of 56\%.  As described below, an upgrade to 2.4 MW is assumed after six years of data collection. The beam design, simulation and associated uncertainties are described in Section~\ref{sec:physics-lbnosc-flux}. 

The signal for \nue appearance is an excess of \dword{cc} %charged-current (CC) 
\nue and \anue interactions over the expected background in the far detector.  The background to \nue appearance is composed of: (1) \dword{cc} interactions of \nue and \anue intrinsic to the beam; (2) misidentified \dword{nc} %neutral current (NC) 
interactions;  (3) misidentified \numu and \anumu \dword{cc} interactions; and (4) $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar{\nu}_\tau$ \dword{cc} interactions in which the $\tau$s decay leptonically into electrons/positrons. \dword{nc} and $\nu_\tau$ backgrounds are due to interactions of higher-energy
neutrinos but they contribute to the selected event samples primarily at low reconstructed energy due to misreconstruction.

The performance parameters for the near and far detectors are described in detail in Sections~\ref{sec:physics-lbnosc-ND} and~\ref{sec:physics-lbnosc-FD}. A full simulation chain that includes the beam flux, the \dword{genie} %GENIE 
neutrino interaction
generator~\cite{Andreopoulos:2009rq}, and \dword{geant4}-based %Geant4-based 
detector models has been implemented. 
The reconstruction and particle identification in the Far Detector has also been fully implemented as described in Section~\ref{sec:physics-lbnosc-FD}. For the Near Detector a parameterized reconstruction based on true energy deposits in the active detector volumes has been used as described in Section~\ref{sec:physics-lbnosc-ND}. The neutrino interaction model has been generated using \dword{genie} 2.12 and the choices of models and tunes as well as associated uncertainties are described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:nu-osc-05}.

The neutrino oscillation parameters and the uncertainty on those parameters are taken from the Nu-FIT4.0~\cite{Esteban:2018azc,nufitweb} global fit to neutrino data; the
values are given in Table~\ref{tab:oscpar_nufit}.  (See also
\cite{deSalas:2017kay} and \cite{Capozzi:2017yic} for other recent global fits.) Most of the sensitivities in this Chapter are shown assuming normal ordering; this is an arbitrary choice for simplicity of presentation.

Sensitivities are presented as a function of calendar years and are calculated with the following assumed deployment plan, which is based on a technically limited schedule.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Start of beam run: Two \dword{fd} module %FD 
    volumes for total fiducial mass of 20 kt, 1.2 MW beam, initial \dword{nd} %ND 
    constraints
    \item After one year: Add one \dword{fd} module  volume for total fiducial mass of 30 kt
    \item After three years: Add one \dword{fd} module  volume for total fiducial mass of \fdfiducialmass, improved \dword{nd} module  constraints
    \item After six years: Upgrade to 2.4 MW beam
\end{itemize}

\num{1285}~km. The spectra are shown for a \num{3.5}~year (staged) exposure each for neutrino and antineutrino beam mode, for a total run time of seven %\num{7}
