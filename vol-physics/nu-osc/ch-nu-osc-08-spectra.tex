\section{Analysis Spectra and Samples}
%{\it Assigned to:} {\bf Dan Cherdack and Chris Marshall}

The analysis spectra for the near and far detector that make it into the fitter. This might be merged into the previous or next section(s). Plots of samples that are necessary for the fit. 

\subsection{Near  Detector Samples}
\begin{itemize}
\item Event spectra broken down into exclusive channels 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Far Detector Samples}
\begin{itemize}
\item Event spectra broken down into exclusive channels (Update CafAna figure)
\end{itemize}
