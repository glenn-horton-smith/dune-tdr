ch-nu-osc-03-methods.tex:Sensitivities to the neutrino mass ordering, \dword{cpv}, and $\theta_{23}$ octant, as well as expected resolution for neutrino oscillation parameter measurements, are obtained by simultaneously fitting the \numutonumu, $\bar{\nu}_\mu \rightarrow \bar{\nu}_\mu$, \numutonue, and $\bar{\nu}_\mu \rightarrow \bar{\nu}_e$ far detector spectra along with selected samples from the near detector.  It is assumed that 50\% of the total exposure is in neutrino beam mode and 50\% in antineutrino beam mode.  A 50\%/50\% ratio of neutrino to antineutrino data has been shown to produce a nearly optimal sensitivity, and small deviations from this (e.g., 40\%/60\%, 60\%/40\%) produce negligible changes in the sensitivity. %\todo{check this is still the case} 
ch-nu-osc-03-methods.tex:Within all fits, neutrino oscillation parameters are all allowed to vary, constrained by a Gaussian prior with 1$\sigma$ width as given by the relative uncertainties shown in Table~\ref{tab:oscpar_nufit}. Systematic uncertainty constraints from the near detector are included either by explicit inclusion of near detector samples within the fit or by applying constraints expected from the near detector data to \dword{fd}-only fits.
ch-nu-osc-03-methods.tex:A ``typical experiment'' is defined as one with the most probable data given a set of input parameters, i.e., in which no statistical fluctuations have been applied. In this case, the predicted spectra and the true spectra are identical; for the example of \dword{cpv}, $\chi^2_{\mdeltacp^{true}}$ is identically zero and the $\Delta\chi^2_{CP}$ value for a typical experiment is given by $\chi^2_{\mdeltacp^{test}}$. The interpretation of $\sqrt{\Delta\chi^2}$ has been discussed in \cite{Qian:2012zn,Blennow:2013oma}; it may be interpreted as approximately equivalent to significance in $\sigma$. 
ch-nu-osc-03-methods.tex:\dword{dune} sensitivity has been studied using several different fitting frameworks. GLoBES (General Long Baseline Experiment Simulator)\cite{Huber:2004ka,Huber:2007ji} %facilitates the use of standardized input formats to calculate predicted spectra and defines methods that enable a test statistic to be computed given a set of inputs. The details of DUNE's GLoBES implementation have been described in \cite{Acciarri:2015uup,Alion:2016uaj,Bass:2014vta}. GLoBES
ch-nu-osc-03-methods.tex:-based fits have been used extensively in the past, in particular for sensitivity studies presented in the \dword{dune} \dword{cdr}; details are available in \cite{Acciarri:2015uup,Alion:2016uaj,Bass:2014vta}. \dword{globes} is now used primarily for quick studies in support of algorithm development and optimization. \dword{valor}\cite{valorweb} has also been used for internal studies. \dword{cafana}, described in Section~\ref{sect:methods-cafana}, was initially developed within the \dword{nova} collaboration and is the primary fitting framework for \dword{dune}. Unless otherwise noted, fits presented in this document are performed within \dword{cafana}. Section~\ref{sect:methods-dunefits} describes the detailed implementation of \dword{dune} fits within the \dword{cafana} fitting framework.
ch-nu-osc-03-methods.tex:To demonstrate the sensitivity reach of \dword{dune}, we have adopted the analysis framework known as \dword{cafana}. This framework was initially developed for the \dword{nova} experiment and has been used for $\nu_\mu$-disappearance, $\nu_e$-appearance, and joint fits, plus sterile neutrino searches and cross-section analyses.

ch-nu-osc-03-methods.tex:Event records representing the reconstructed properties of neutrino interactions and, in the case of  \dword{mc}, the true neutrino properties are processed to fill the required histograms. Oscillated \dword{fd} predictions are created by populating \twod histograms, with the second axis being the true neutrino energy, for each oscillation channel ($\nu_\alpha\to\nu_\beta$). These are then reweighted as a function of the true energy axis according to an exact calculation of the oscillation weight at the bin center %\todo{did joao ever write up PMNSOpt?} 
ch-nu-osc-03-methods.tex:where $P_{\alpha\beta}(E)$ is the probability for a neutrino created in flavor state $\alpha$ to be found in flavor state $\beta$ at the \dword{fd}. $M_{ij}^{\alpha\beta}$ represents the number of selected events in bin $i$ of the reconstructed variable with true energy $E_j$, taken from a simulation where neutrinos of flavor $\alpha$ from the beam have been replaced by equivalent neutrinos in flavor $\beta$. Oscillation parameters that are not displayed are profiled over using {\sc minuit}~\cite{James:1994vla}. That is, their values are set to those that produces the best match with the simulated data at each point in parameter space.
ch-nu-osc-03-methods.tex:The impact of systematic uncertainties is included by adding additional nuisance parameters into the fit. Each of these parameters can have arbitrary effects on the \dword{mc} prediction, and is profiled over in the production of the result. The range of these parameters is controlled by the use of Gaussian penalty terms to reflect our prior knowledge of reasonable variations.
ch-nu-osc-03-methods.tex:Information from the \dword{nd}, which is used to constrain systematic uncertainties, is included via additional $\chi^2$ contributions (Equation \ref{eqn:cafana_ll}) without oscillations. Specific \dword{nd} samples such as neutrino-electron elastic scattering and off-axis samples may be included separately. %\todo{is this enough to foreshadow DUNE Prism?}
ch-nu-osc-03-methods.tex:\dword{dune} sensitivity studies are performed using the \dword{cafana} framework described in the previous section. Fits for sensitivity to \dword{cpv}, neutrino mass ordering, and octant are performed, in addition to 1D and \twod %one- and two-dimensional 
ch-nu-osc-03-methods.tex:The experimental sensitivity is quantified using a test statistic, $\Delta\chi^2$, which is calculated by comparing the predicted spectra for alternate hypotheses. These quantities are defined, differently for neutrino mass ordering, $\theta_{23}$ octant, and \dword{cpv} sensitivity to be:
ch-nu-osc-03-methods.tex:Similarly, expected resolution for oscillation parameters is determined by scanning the value of the oscillation parameter of interest and comparing spectra produced by the varied test value with that of the ``true'' central value. The one-sigma resolution is defined as the difference between the true and test value at which the test statistic, $\Delta\chi^2$, is greater than one, taking the average resolution to allow for cases in which the difference is not symmetric about the true value. In these fits, the oscillation parameter of interest is fixed while the others are free in the fit, with constraints from external measurements applied. Similarly, for the \twod parameter sensitivity plots, the two oscillation parameters of interest are fixed in the fit and scanned over. The \twod allowed region is chosen to be the area inside which the fit test statistic is less than the appropriate $\chi^2$ critical value for two degrees of freedom (e.g., the 90\% \dword{cl} curve is for a critical value of the test statistic of 4.61).
ch-nu-osc-03-methods.tex:Details of these fits are still being finalized -- this section will be updated to describe fit input samples and systematic uncertainties. Data samples included in the \dword{dune} fits presented here are expected to include \dword{fd} \numutonumu and \numutonue samples as well as $\nu_\mu$ \dword{cc} samples, both on- and off-axis, from the \dword{lartpc} \dword{nd}, neutrino-electron elastic scattering samples from the \dword{lartpc} \dword{nd}, and samples from the \dword{gartpc} \dword{nd}. Systematic uncertainties include oscillation parameter variations, flux uncertainties using the \dword{pca} analysis described in Section~\ref{sect:methods-cafana}, neutrino interaction model uncertainties based primarily but not exclusively on \dword{genie} driven uncertainties, and assorted detector uncertainties. These sources of systematic uncertainty and the way they are implemented in the analysis are described in more detail in the following sections.
ch-nu-osc-04-flux.tex:The neutrino fluxes are described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:tools-mc-flux}.  They were generated using G4LBNF, a \textsc{Geant}4\xspace-based simulation of the LBNF neutrino beam.  The simulation was configured to use a detailed description of the \dword{lbnf} optimized beam design~\cite{optimizedbeamcdr}, which includes horns and target designed to optimize sensitivity to \dword{cpv}.   
ch-nu-osc-04-flux.tex:\begin{dunefigure}[Neutrino fluxes at the \dword{fd}]{fig:flux_flavor}
ch-nu-osc-04-flux.tex:{Neutrino fluxes at the \dword{fd} for neutrino mode (left) and
ch-nu-osc-04-flux.tex:Neutrino fluxes for neutrino and antineutrino mode configurations of \dword{lbnf} are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:flux_flavor}.   Uncertainties on the neutrino fluxes arise primarily from uncertainties in hadrons produced off the target and uncertainties in parameters of the beam such as horn currents and horn and target positioning (commonly called ``focusing uncertainties''). Given current measurements of hadron prodution and LBNF estimates of alignment tolerances, these lead to uncertainties of approximately 8\% at the first oscillation maximum and 12\% at the second, and are highly correlated between energy bins and across neutrino flavors.       
ch-nu-osc-04-flux.tex:The fluxes at the \dword{nd} and \dword{fd} are similar, but not identical.  Flux uncertainties mostly cancel for the ratio of fluxes between the two detectors.  Uncertainties on the ratio are around 1\% or smaller except at the falling edge of the focusing peak, where they rise to 2\%.    
ch-nu-osc-04-flux.tex:The neutrino flux spreads beyond the beam directly aimed at the \dword{dune} \dword{fd} and viable neutrino fluxes extend outward at the \dword{nd} hall. The relationship between the parent pion energy and neutrino energy is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:OAAFluxFigs}; for an ``off-axis'' angle relative to the initial beam direction, the subsequent neutrino energy spectra is narrower and peaked at a lower energy than the on-axis spectra. At $575\,\textrm{m}$, the location of the \dword{nd} hall, a lateral shift of $1\,\textrm{m}$ corresponds to approximately a $0.1^\circ$ change in off-axis angle.

ch-nu-osc-04-flux.tex:The same sources of systematic uncertainty which affect the on-axis spectra also modify the off-axis spectra.  Generally, the size of the off-axis uncertainties is comparable to the on-axis uncertainties and the uncertainties are highly correlated across off-axis and on-axis positions. Studies of extreme changes to horn positions and current indicate that the larger than expected shifts to the horn focusing elements (as has been historically seen in \dword{numi}) would induce significant changes off-axis. Therefore, off-axis flux measurements are useful to diagnose beamline physics, and to further constrain flux uncertainties.
ch-nu-osc-05-nuint.tex:The goal of parameterizing the neutrino interaction model uncertainties is to provide a framework for considering how these uncertainties effect the oscillation analysis at the \dword{fd}, and for considering how constraints at the \dword{nd} can limit those uncertainties.

Therefore, it was not practical to use \dword{genie} 3 for this work.}
ch-nu-osc-05-nuint.tex:, will not contain all of the possible cross section variations which need to be modeled.  Therefore, the variations in the cross sections to be considered are implemented as some combination of: \dword{genie} weighting parameters (sometimes referred to as ``\dword{genie} knobs''), {\it ad hoc} weights of events which are designed to parameterize uncertainties or cross section corrections currently not implemented within \dword{genie}, and as discrete alternative model comparisons, achieved through alternate generators, alternate \dword{genie} configurations, or custom weightings. 
ch-nu-osc-05-nuint.tex:The interaction uncertainties are divided into seven roughly exclusive groups: (1) initial state uncertainties, (2) hard scattering uncertainties and nuclear modifications to the quasielastic process, (3) uncertainties in multinucleon (2p2h) hard scattering processes, (4) hard scattering uncertainties in pion production processes, (5) uncertainties governing other, higher $W$ and neutral current processes, (6) \dword{fsi} uncertainties, (7) neutrino flavor-dependent uncertainties. Uncertainties are intended to reflect current theoretical freedom, deficiencies in implementation, and/or current experimental knowledge.  In many cases of nuclear effects, there are relatively stringent constraints on processes because of measurements on lighter targets, but additional sources of uncertainty on argon. 
ch-nu-osc-05-nuint.tex:Initial state uncertainties, for example the average energy required to separate a nucleon from the nucleus, are evaluated within a modified global Fermi gas model.  Alternate initial state models exist. Spectral functions~\cite{Benhar:1994hw,Nieves:2004wx}, the mean field model of \dword{gibuu}~\cite{Gallmeister:2016dnq}, or \dword{crpa} calculations~\cite{Pandey:2014tza} all appear to  provide better descriptions of the nuclear initial state~\cite{Sobczyk:2017mts}.   It is generally impossible to weight predictions from one initial state model to another to compare predictions, because they occupy different phase space, and such studies would have to be done with alternate \dword{mc} simulations. Here, we attempt, where possible, to approximate relevant alternate models of effect with weights, with that as a limitation.
ch-nu-osc-05-nuint.tex:Hard scattering uncertainties in quasielastic scattering,  pion production, and higher $W$ processes are implemented in \dword{genie}.  In some cases, we augment the uncertainties included in \dword{genie} to reflect observed discrepancies in neutrino scattering.
ch-nu-osc-05-nuint.tex: In 2018, \dword{minerva} and \dword{nova} parameterized the central value and uncertainty in $(q_0, q_3)$ following the prescription of Ref.~\cite{RikRPA}, whereas \dword{t2k} used central values and uncertainties in $Q^2$ only. Here we use \dword{t2k}'s 2017/8 parameterization of the \dword{rpa} effect\cite{t2k_2018} due to its simplicity.
ch-nu-osc-05-nuint.tex:We start with the Nieves et al.\ or ``Valencia'' model~\cite{nieves1,nieves2} for multinucleon ($2p2h$) contributions to to the cross section.  However, \dword{minerva} has shown directly~\cite{Rodrigues:2015hik}, and \dword{nova} indirectly, that this description is missing observed strength on carbon. The extra strength from the ``\dword{minerva} tune'' to $2p2h$ is applied in $(q_0,q_3)$ space (where $q_0$ is energy transfer from the leptonic system, and $q_3$ is the magnitude of the three momentum transfer). Reasonable fits to \dword{minerva}'s data are found by attributing the missing strength to any of $2p2h$ from $np$ initial state pairs, $2p2h$ from $nn$ initial state pairs, or $1p1h$ or quasielastic processes.  
ch-nu-osc-05-nuint.tex:The rates for $1p1h$ and $2p2h$ processes could be different on argon and carbon targets.  There is little neutrino scattering data to inform this, but there are measurements of short-ranged correlated pairs from electron scattering on different nuclei~\cite{Colle:2015ena}.   We add additional uncertainties to account for this possibility, constrained by electron scattering measurements.  Similarly, the discrepancies observed by \dword{nova} and \dword{minerva} may be neutrino energy dependent, and additional uncertainties are added to account for this.
ch-nu-osc-06-nd.tex:Oscillation parameters are determined by comparing observed charged-current event spectra at the \dword{fd} to predictions from simulation. These predictions are subject to uncertainties on the neutrino flux and cross sections at the level of tens of percent, as described in the preceding sections. To achieve the required few percent precision of \dword{dune}, it is necessary to constrain these uncertainties with a highly capable suite of \dwords{nd}.
ch-nu-osc-06-nd.tex:The broad \dword{nd} concept is described in Section~\ref{sec:ndconcept}, along with an outline of the \dword{nd}'s role in the oscillation analysis. The reconstruction and event selection is described in Section~\ref{sec:ndsimreco}. More detail can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:nu-osc-12}. \dword{nd} and \dword{fd} uncertainties are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:physics-lbnosc-syst}.
ch-nu-osc-06-nd.tex:The \dword{dune} \dword{nd} system consists of a \dword{lartpc}

These features greatly reduce reconstruction ambiguities that hamper monolithic, projective-readout \dwords{tpc}, and enable the \dword{nd} to function in the high-intensity environment of the \dword{dune} \dword{nd} site. For containment of hadron showers the active dimensions are at least $4 \times 3$ m in the directions transverse to the beam, and 5 m in the beam direction, giving a total mass of at least 84 tons. The \dword{lar} detector is movable, to facilitate measurements at both on-axis and off-axis positions.
ch-nu-osc-06-nd.tex:The \dword{mptdet} sits immediately downstream of the \dword{lar} cryostat, in a magnetic field with a strength of at least 0.4 T. It consists of a \dword{gartpc} %gaseous argon TPC

ch-nu-osc-06-nd.tex:The \dword{lar} $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ \dword{cc} samples are divided into \twod bins on neutrino energy and inelasticity. Additionally, a sample of neutrino-electron elastic scattering events is isolated and used as a direct constraint on the flux normalization. Gas \dword{tpc} samples are used to constrain exclusive cross sections and nuclear effects, leveraging the low threshold and excellent \dword{pid} of the gaseous detector. Off-axis measurements on \dword{lar} are used to directly constrain uncertainties in energy reconstruction resulting from unmodeled detector and interaction uncertainties.
ch-nu-osc-06-nd.tex:Neutrino interactions are simulated in the active volumes of the \dword{lar} and \dword{hpg} \dwords{tpc}. The neutrino flux prediction is described in Section~\ref{ch:osc-bm-nus}. Interactions are simulated with the \dword{genie} event generator using the model configuration described in Section~\ref{sec:nu-osc-05}. The propagation of neutrino interaction products through the detector volumes is simulated using a \dword{geant4}-based model. Pattern recognition and reconstruction software has not yet been developed for the \dword{nd}. Instead, we perform a parameterized reconstruction based on true energy deposits in active detector volumes as simulated by \dword{geant4}. This section gives a qualitative overview of the selection, which is described in detail in Appendix~\ref{sec:nu-osc-12}.
ch-nu-osc-06-nd.tex:Liquid argon events are selected from a central $6 \times 2 \times 3$~m$^{3}$~fiducial volume that excludes 50 cm around the edges of the detector and 150cm downstream, which is required for good containment of hadronic showers. Hadronic energy is estimated by summing visible energy deposits in the active \dword{lar} volume. Events are rejected when energy is observed in the outer 30 cm of the detector, which is evidence of poor hadronic containment. This leads to an acceptance that decreases with hadronic energy, as shown in the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:NDreco}.
ch-nu-osc-06-nd.tex:Electrons are generally contained in the \dword{lar} and are reconstructed calorimetrically. Muons are contained up to kinetic energies of $\sim$1 GeV, above which they typically exit the detector. Forward exiting muons will enter the magnetized \dword{mptdet}, where their momenta and charge sign are reconstructed by curvature. The acceptance is somewhat lower at large angles, as shown in the center panel of Figure~\ref{fig:NDreco}.
ch-nu-osc-06-nd.tex:Events are classified as either $\nu_{\mu}$ \dword{cc}, $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ CC, $\nu_{e}$+$\bar{\nu}_{e}$ \dword{cc}, or \dword{nc} based on the presence of charged leptons. Backgrounds to $\nu_{\mu}$ \dword{cc} arise from \dword{nc} $\pi^{\pm}$ production where the pion leaves a long track and does not shower. Muons below about 400 MeV kinetic energy have a significant background from charged pions, so these \dword{cc} events are excluded from the selected sample. Backgrounds to $\nu_{e}$ \dword{cc} arise from photons that convert very near the interaction vertex. The largest contribution is from $\pi^{0}$ production with highly asymmetric decay.
ch-nu-osc-06-nd.tex:{Left: Reconstructed vs. true neutrino energy for $\nu_{\mu}$ \dword{cc} events with either contained or MPT-matched muon and ell-contained hadronic shower. The bin at zero true energy corresponds to events that are not true $\nu_{\mu}$ \dword{cc}, which are mostly neutral current with a charged pion faking the muon track, hence the lower energy spectrum. Center: Detector acceptance for $\nu_{\mu}$ \dword{cc} events as a function of muon transverse and longitudinal momentum. Right: Acceptance as a function of hadronic energy; the black line is for the full fiducial volume while the red line is for a $1 \times 1 \times 1$~m$^{3}$ volume in the center, and the blue curve is the expected distribution of hadronic energy given the \dword{dune} flux.}
ch-nu-osc-06-nd.tex:The \dword{lartpc} has sufficient energy and angular resolution to separate the signal, peaked at low $E_{e}\theta_{e}^{2}$, from backgrounds due to $\nu_{e}$ \dword{cc} scattering and from \dword{nc} $\pi^{0}$ production. The expected rate is \num{3300} events per year, so that the statistical uncertainty on the absolute flux normalization can be constrained to $\sim$1\% with three years of running. The dominant systematic uncertainty is expected to be the $\nu_{e}$ \dword{cc} shape at low $Q^{2}$, and can be constrained with sidebands to the $\sim$1\% level so that the overall uncertainty is $\sim$2\%.
ch-nu-osc-06-nd.tex:\subsubsection{Off-axis \dword{nd} measurements}
ch-nu-osc-06-nd.tex:Neutrino energy reconstruction is one of the biggest challenges in a precision long-baseline oscillation experiment like \dword{dune}. Even with a highly capable \dword{fd}, a fraction of the final-state hadronic energy is typically not observed. For example, neutrons may travel meters without interacting, and can exit the detector with significant kinetic energy. This missing energy is typically corrected with a neutrino interaction generator, which is used to relate the true neutrino energy to the observed energy. These models have many tens of uncertain parameters, which can be constrained by \dword{nd} measurements. However, there may be many different parameter combinations that adequately describe the \dword{nd} data. These degenerate solutions can extrapolate differently to the \dword{fd}, where the flux is significantly different, primarily due to oscillations. This can lead to biases in the fitted oscillation parameters, including $\delta_{CP}$, despite an apparently good quality of fit.
ch-nu-osc-06-nd.tex:These biases can be partially mitigated by an on-axis \dword{nd} capable of making numerous exclusive measurements, including a direct flux measurement via neutrino-electron elastic scattering. However, the energy dependence of the interaction cross section and the bias in reconstructed neutrino energy cannot be measured in a single beam. To gain sensitivity to this physics, the \dword{lartpc} detector is movable, and the \dword{nd} hall is oriented to facilitate both on-axis measurements and measurements at positions up to 33 m off axis. The flux spectrum varies as a function of off-axis angle, peaking lower in energy as the angle is increased, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:OAAFluxFigs}. As uncertainties in the flux prediction are strongly correlated across off-axis angles, off-axis measurements of reconstructed neutrino energy constrain cross section uncertainties and provide futher handles on possible degeneracies in the fit. By taking linear combinations of such measurements, it is possible to reproduce the predicted \dword{fd} oscillated flux for some set of oscillation parameters, and directly compare visible energy between \dword{nd} and \dword{fd} over essentially the same flux, and with greatly reduced model dependence. Figure~\ref{fig:nd_prism} shows the result of such a linear combination, overlaid with the \dword{fd} flux. The off-axis technique cannot reproduce the \dword{fd} flux tail. The lower $E_{\nu}$ bound is determined by the range of accessible off-axis angles; to cover the second oscillation maximum down to 0.5 GeV, measurements out to 33 m off axis are required.
ch-nu-osc-06-nd.tex:{The predicted \dword{fd} flux (black), and a prediction made up of linear combinations of \dword{nd} fluxes (green).}
ch-nu-osc-06-nd.tex:A potential run plan is to take on-axis data approximately 50\% of the time, with the other 50\% split among enough off-axis positions so that the fiducial volumes of adjacent ``stops'' overlap, giving a continuous range of angles. Event selection at an off-axis location of the \dword{lar} detector is identical to the on-axis case. The selection efficiency varies as a function of muon energy due to containment and matching to the downstream magnetized tracker, and as a function of hadronic energy due to containment. As muon and hadronic energy are correlated to neutrino energy, the efficiency varies with off-axis position. The efficiency also varies as a function of vertex position; interactions occurring near the edges of the detector are more likely to fail containment requirements. These effects are corrected with simulation; as they are largely geometric, the uncertainties that arise from the corrections are very small compared to the uncertainties on neutrino cross sections and energy reconstruction. More details on the off-axis analysis are found in Appendix~\ref{sec:physics-lbnosc-ND-app}.
ch-nu-osc-06-nd.tex:With over 30 million charged-current events per year, the \dword{lartpc} event sample can be analyzed in many different exclusive channels and provide powerful constraints. However, its relatively high density makes certain hadronic topologies challenging to reconstruct. With its low reconstruction thresholds, excellent pion/proton separation, and charge reconstruction, the gaseous \dword{tpc} complements the \dword{lar} detector. In particular, measurements of proton and charged pion multiplicities as a function of neutrino energy constrain cross section uncertainties not accessible to the \dword{lar} alone.
ch-nu-osc-06-nd.tex:In addition, the gas \dword{tpc} provides a useful check on the reconstruction efficiency of the \dword{lar} selection. Due to the combining of contained muons with gas \dword{tpc}-matched events, there are kinematic regions where the acceptance of the \dword{lartpc} is uncertain. Also, without a magnetic field, the wrong sign contamination cannot be directly measured, especially at high angle and low energy. The gas \dword{tpc}, however, has uniform acceptance over the full 4$\pi$, as well as charge measurement capability except when the muon is nearly parallel to the magnetic field lines.
ch-nu-osc-06-nd.tex:Unlike the \dword{lartpc}, where the hadronic energy is determined by a calorimetric sum of energy deposits, the gas \dword{tpc} hadronic energy is reconstructed particle-by-particle, including pion masses. For this analysis, samples of $\nu_{\mu}$ \dword{cc} events are selected in slices of charged pion multiplicity, and fit as a function of reconstructed neutrino energy. The threshold for charged pion selection is 5 MeV, and $\pi^{+}$ can be reliably separated from protons up to momenta of 1.3 GeV/c.
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:The calculation of \dword{dune} sensitivities to oscillation parameter measurements requires predictions for the number of events to be observed in the \dword{fd} fiducial volume, the reconstructed neutrino energy for each of these events, and the probability that they will be correctly identified as signal for each analysis samples. To build these analysis samples a  GEANT4 simulation of the \dword{fd} has been developed. The output of that simulation has been used to build neutrino energy estimators, and an event selection discriminant that can separate \dword{cc} $\nu_{e}$, \dword{cc} $\nu_{\mu}$, and \dword{nc} events. Each of these components is described in detail in this section. The uncertainties associated with each step in the simulation and reconstruction chain, including the \dword{fd} simulation, reconstructed energy estimators, and selection efficiencies are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:nu-osc-09}. 
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:The neutrino samples were simulated using a smaller version of the full \nominalmodsize far \dword{detmodule} geometry. This geometry is 13.9 m long, \tpcheight high and 13.3 m wide, which consists of 12 \dword{apa}s and 24 \dwords{cpa}. The reference flux was used (Section~\ref{sec:physics-lbnosc-flux}) and samples were produced with both the forward-horn-current (neutrino enhanced) and inverted-horn-current (antineutrino enhanced) beam configurations. Three samples were generated. The first sample keeps the original neutrino flavor in the beam. The second sample converts all the muon neutrinos to electron neutrios. The third sample converts all the muon neutrinos to tau neutrinos. Oscillation probabilities are used to weight \dword{cc} events to build oscillated \dword{fd} predictions from the three event samples. \dword{genie} 2.12.10 was used to model the neutrino-argon interactions in the volume of cryostat. The produced final-state (after \dword{fsi}) particles were propagated in the detector through \dword{geant4}. %{\sc geant}. Check if right!
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:The ionization electrons and scintillation light were digitized to produce signals in the wire planes and \dwords{pd}. More details on the simulation can be found in the Physics Tools and Methods chapter.
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:The first step in the reconstruction is to convert the raw signal from each wire to a standard (e.g., Gaussian) shape. This is achieved by passing the raw data through a calibrated deconvolution algorithm to remove the impact of the \dword{lartpc} \efield and electronics responses from the measured signal.
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:The hit-finding algorithm scans the processed wire waveform looking for local minima. If a minimum is found, the algorithm follows the waveform after this point until it finds a local maximum. If the maximum is above a specified threshold, the program scans to the next local minimum and identifies this region as a hit. Hits are fit with a Gaussian function whose features identify the correct position (time coordinate), width, height, and area (deposited charge) of the hit. A single Gaussian function is used to describe hits produced by isolated single particles. In regions where there are overlapping particles (e.g., around neutrino interaction vertex) single Gaussian fits may fail, and fits to multiple Gaussian functions may be used. The reconstructed hits are used by pattern recognition algorithms and the \dword{cvn} event selection algorithms described later in this section.
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:Pattern recognition algorithms (\dword{pandora} and \dword{pma}) define clusters as hits that may be grouped together due to proximity in time and space to one another. Clusters from different wire planes are matched to form high-level objects such as tracks and showers. These high level objects are used as inputs to the neutrino energy reconstruction algorithm. More details on the reconstruction can be found in the Physics Tools and Methods chapter.
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:The energy of the incoming neutrino in \dword{cc} events is estimated by adding the reconstructed lepton and hadronic energies. 
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:If the event is selected as $\nu_{\mu}$ \dword{cc}, the neutrino energy is estimated as the sum of the energy of the longest reconstructed track and the hadronic energy. The energy of the longest reconstructed track is estimated from its range if the track is contained in the detector, and this is calibrated using simulated $\nu_{\mu}$ \dword{cc} events with true muon energies from 0.2-1.7 GeV. If the longest track exits the detector, its energy is estimated from multi-Coulomb scattering, and corrected using simulated events with true muon energies from 0.5-3 GeV. The hadronic energy is estimated from the charges of reconstructed hits that

ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:\subsection{Neutrino Event Selection using the \dword{cvn}}
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:The \dword{dune} \dword{cvn} classifies neutrino interactions in the \dword{dune} \dword{fd} through image recognition techniques. In general terms it is a \dword{cnn}. Similar techniques have been demonstrated to outperform traditional methods in many aspects of high energy physics~\cite{radovicNature}.
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:The primary goal of the \dword{cvn} is to efficiently and accurately produce event selections of the following interactions: \dword{cc}$\nu_\mu$ and \dword{cc}$\nu_e$ in the FHC beam mode, and \dword{cc}$\bar{\nu}_\mu$ and \dword{cc}$\bar{\nu}_e$ in the \dword{rhc} beam mode. Future goals will include studies of exclusive neutrino interaction final states since separating the event selections by interaction type can improve the sensitivity as interaction types have different energy resolutions and systematic uncertainties. Detailed descriptions of the \dword{cvn} architecture can be found in Ref.~\cite{cvnPaper}.
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:An important feature for the \dword{dune} \dword{cvn} is the fine-grained detail of a \dword{lartpc} encoded in the input images to be propagated further into the \dword{cvn}. This detail is more than what would be possible using a traditional \dword{cnn} such as the GoogLeNet (also called Inception v1)~\cite{GoogLeNet} inspired network used by \dword{nova}~\cite{novacvn}. To accomplish this, the \dword{cvn} design is based on the SE-ResNet architecture, which consists of a standard ResNet (Residual neural network) architecture~\cite{He-et-al-2015-deep} along with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks~\cite{Hu-et-al-2017-squeeze}. Residual neural networks allow the $n^{th}$ layer access to the output of both the $(n-1)^{th}$ layer and the $(n-k)^{th}$ layer via a residual connection, where $k$ is a positive integer $>=2$.
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:\subsubsection{Inputs to the \dword{cvn}}
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:Three images of the neutrino interactions are produced, one for each of the three readout views, using the reconstructed hits on the individual wire planes. The images are not dependent on any further downstream reconstruction algorithms. The images contain 500 $\times$ 500 pixels, each in the (wire, time) parameter space, where the wire is the wire channel number and the time is the peak time of the reconstructed hit measured in \dwords{tdc}. The value of each pixel represents the integrated charge of the reconstructed hit. An example simulated 2.2\,GeV \dword{cc}$\nu_e$ interaction is shown in all three views in Figure~\ref{fig:views} demonstrating the fine-grained detail available from the \dword{lartpc} technology.

The horizontal axis shows the wire number of the readout plane and the vertical axis shows time. The greyscale shows the charge of the energy deposits on the wires.}
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:\subsubsection{Training the \dword{cvn}}
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:The \dword{cvn} was trained using approximately three million neutrino interactions from the \dword{mc} simulation. An independent of the sample is used to generate the physics measurement sensitivities. The training sample was chosen to ensure similar numbers of training examples from the different neutrino flavors. Validation was performed to ensure that similar classification performance was obtained for the training and test samples, i.e., the \dword{cvn} was not overtrained.
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:\subsubsection{Outputs from the \dword{cvn}}
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:The \dword{cvn}, as currently constructed, has six different outputs:
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:    \item Primary output -- neutrino flavor: returns probabilities that each interaction is one of the following classes: \dword{cc}$\nu_\mu$, \dword{cc}$\nu_e$, \dword{cc}$\nu_\tau$ and \dword{nc}.
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:The primary goal of the \dword{cvn} is to accurately identify \dword{cc}$\nu_e$ interactions and \dword{cc}$\nu_\mu$ interactions to allow for the selection of the samples required for the neutrino oscillation analysis. The \dword{cc}$\nu_e$ probability distribution, $P(\textrm{CC}\nu_e)$, and the \dword{cc}$\nu_\mu$ probability distribution, $P(\textrm{CC}\nu_\mu)$, are shown on the left and right of Figure~\ref{fig:cvnprob}, respectively. Excellent separation between the signal and background interactions is seen in both cases.
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:	\caption{The \dword{cvn} \dword{cc}$\nu_e$ probability (left) and \dword{cc}$\nu_\mu$ probability (right) for the \dword{fhc} beam mode shown with a log scale.}
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:The \dword{cc}$\nu_e$ event selection uses events where $P(\textrm{CC}\nu_e) > 0.85$ for an interaction to be considered a \dword{cc}$\nu_e$ candidate event. Similarly, interactions are selected as \dword{cc}$\nu_\mu$ candidates if $P(\textrm{CC}\nu_\mu) > 0.5$. Note that since all of the flavor classification probabilities must sum to one, the interactions selected in the two event selections are completely independent. The same selection criteria are used for both \dword{fhc} and \dword{rhc} beam modes. The values used in the selection criteria were optimized to produce the best $\delta_{CP}$ sensitivity.
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:Figure~\ref{fig:nueeff} shows the efficiency as a function of reconstructed energy (under the electron neutrino hypothesis) for the $\nu_e$ event selection. The efficiency in both the FHC and RHC beam modes exceeds 90\% in the neutrino flux peak. The good agreement with the selection efficiency from teh \dword{dune} \dword{cdr}, which were developed using a parameterized detector response, provides reasonable confidence in the \dword{cvn} approach. Figure~\ref{fig:numueff} shows the corresponding excellent selection efficiency for the $\nu_\mu$ event selection.

ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:The \dword{cvn} has four outputs that count the number of final-state particles for the following species: protons, charged pions, neutral pions and neutrons. Neutrino interactions with different final-state (after \dword{fsi}) particles can have varying energy resolutions due to differences in the complexity and particle multiplicity observed in the detector. The ability to accurately select exclusive final-states will allow for those interactions with very good energy resolution to be fully exploited in the oscillation fit to improve the sensitivity of the analysis. This information is not currently used in the analysis.
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:The individual output probabilities from the \dword{cvn} can be multiplied together to give probabilities for exclusive selections. For example, Figure~\ref{fig:exclusive} shows the CC$\nu_\mu$ 1 proton probability on the left formed by the product 
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:and the \dword{nc}$\pi^0$ probability on the right, defined similarly: 
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:The background and signal distributions, closely peaked toward 0 and 1 respectively, demonstrate that the accurate selection of exclusive final states will be possible with the \dword{dune} \dword{cvn} technique.

ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:A large \dword{dune} prototype, \dword{pdsp}~\cite{Abi:2017aow}, collected data in a charged particle test beam at CERN in autumn 2018. Whilst there were no neutrino interactions, the data from \dword{pdsp} still provides the first important opportunity to compare the performance of the \dword{cvn} between data and simulation. Images can be created from individual reconstructed particles, including cosmic ray muons and test-beam electrons and positrons. For example, a cosmic ray muon image
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:can mimic a simple \dword{cc}$\nu_\mu$ interaction, which can then be classified by the \dword{cvn}. The expected classification is \dword{cc}$\nu_\mu$ with no other final-state particles, and the distribution of this probability is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:protodunecvn} for data and simulation.
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:    \caption{Comparison of the \dword{cvn} response to cosmic ray muons in \dword{protodune} data and simulation. TODO: this plot will be updated with a better plot after the next round of \dword{protodune} data processing}
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:Experience in ensuring robustness of deep learning image recognition techniques already exists within the community. For example, the \dword{nova} experiment uses a technique that takes clear \dword{cc}$\nu_\mu$ interactions identified in data and simulation and removes all of the reconstructed hits associated with the reconstructed muon track. The reconstructed muon is replaced by a simulated electron with the same kinematic variables~\cite{NOvA_MRE}. This procedure was originally developed by \dword{minos}~\cite{MINOS_MRE}, and allows a large sample of data-like electron neutrino interactions to be studied and excellent agreement was seen between the performance of the event selection for data and simulation. This approach will prove critical once \dword{dune} begins data taking to ensure the performance of the \dword{cvn} is the same for data and simulation.
ch-nu-osc-07-fd.tex:A full event simulation has been implemented, including realistic neutrino energy reconstruction and event selection algorithms which yields an appropriately accurate representation of the \dword{fd} samples to be used in the long-baseline oscillation analysis. The samples used in the sensitivity studies presented in this document require event by event simulations that effectively produce the convolution of the neutrino flux model, neutrino-argon scattering models, and models of the detector response. This last step must include estimates of energy smearing and bias, as well as the impact of a realistic event selection on signal acceptance and background rejection rates. This section has outlined the methods used to implement these algorithms. The final product is the  selected \dword{fd} event samples shown as a function of reconstructed neutrino energy in Section~\ref{sec:physics-lbnosc-osc}. Figure~\ref{fig:appspectra} shows the \numutonue and $\bar{\nu}_\mu \to \bar{\nu}_e$ appearance spectra and Figure~\ref{fig:disspectra} shows the \numutonumu and  $\bar{\nu}_\mu \to \bar{\nu}_\mu$ disappearance spectra. Tables~\ref{tab:apprates} and \ref{tab:disrates} provide the signal and background event rates for the appearance and disappearance analyses, respectively. Based on these predictions we observe the largest background to the \nue \dword{cc} appearance signal to be the intrinsic beam \nue interactions. There is also a contribution from misidentified neutral current interactions as well as small contributions from misidentified \numu and \nutau interactions. The \numu disappearance signal has negligible background, though there is a significant ``wrong-sign''  \numu component in the $\bar{\numu}$ sample. The uncertainties on these predictions including those stemming from the detector response model, energy reconstruction and event selection algorithm are discussed in the next Section.
ch-nu-osc-09-syst.tex:The near \dword{lartpc} detector uses a similar technology as the far detector, namely they are both \dwords{lartpc}. However, important differences lead to uncertainties that do not fully correlate between the two detectors. First, the readout technology is different, as the near \dword{lartpc} uses pixels as well as a different, modular photon detector. Therefore, the charge response to particle types (e.g., muons and protons) will be different between near and far due to differences in electronics readout, noise, and local effects like alignment.  Second, the high-intensity environment of the \dword{nd} complicates associating detatched energy deposits to events, a problem which does not exist in the \dword{fd}. Third, the calibration programs will be very different. For example, the \dword{nd} has a high-statistics calibration sample of through-going, momentum-analyzed muons from neutrino interactions in the upstream rock, which does not exist for the \dword{fd}. Conversely, the local \efield in the \dword{nd} will be complicated by ion accumulation (space charge) as it has much less overburden than the \dword{fd}. Finally, the reconstruction efficiency will be inherently different due to the relatively small size of the \dword{nd}. Containment of charged hadrons will be significantly worse at the \dword{nd}, especially for events with energetic hadronic showers or which vertex near the edges of the fiducial volume. Detector systematics in the \dword{gartpc} at the near site will be entirely uncorrelated to the \dword{fd}.
ch-nu-osc-09-syst.tex:The scale of these uncertainties is derived from recent experiments, including calorimetric based approaches (\dword{nova}, \dword{minerva}) and \dwords{lartpc} (\dword{lariat}, \dword{microboone}, \dword{argoneut}). On \dword{nova}~\cite{NOvA:2018gge}, the muon (proton) energy scale achieved is $<1$\% (5\%). Uncertainties associated to the pion and proton re-interactions in the detector medium are expected to be controlled from \dword{protodune} and \dword{lariat} data, as well as the combined analysis of low density (gaseous) and high density (\dword{lar}) \dwords{nd}. Uncertainties in the \efield also contribute to energy scale, and calibration is needed (with cosmics at \dword{nd}, laser system at \dword{fd}) to constrain the overall energy scale. The recombination model will continue to be validated by the suite of \dword{lar} experiments and is not expected to be an issue for nominal field provided minimal \efield distortions. 
ch-nu-osc-09-syst.tex:The response of the detector to neutrons is a source of active study and will couple strongly to detector technology. The validation of neutron interactions in \dword{lar} will continue to be characterized by dedicated measurements (CAPTAIN) and the LAR program (e.g., \dword{argoneut}~\cite{PhysRevD.99.012002}).  However, the association of the identification of a neutron scatter or capture to the neutrons true energy has not been demonstrated, and significant reconstruction issues exist, so a large uncertainty (20\%) is assigned comparable to the observations made by \dword{minerva}~\cite{Elkins:2019vmy} assuming they are attributed entirely to the detector model. Selection of photon candidates from $\pi^0$ is also a significant reconstruction challenge, but a recent measurement from \dword{microboone} indicates this is possible and the $\pi^0$ invariant mass has an uncertainty of 5\%, although with some bias~\cite{Adams:2018sgn}.

ch-nu-osc-09-syst.tex:Uncertainties are evaluated on the muon and hadron acceptance, as well as on the energy reconstruction. The detector acceptance for muons and hadrons is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:NDreco}. Inefficiency at very low lepton energy is due to events being misreconstructed as neutral current, which can also be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:recoEvcats}. For high energy, forward muons, the inefficiency is only due to events near the edge of the fiducial volume where the muon misses the \dword{mpt}. At high transverse momentum, muons begin to exit the side of the \dword{lar} active volume, except when they happen to go along the 7 m axis. The acceptance is sensitive to the modeling of muons in the detector. An uncertainty is estimated based on the change in the acceptance as a function of muon kinematics.

The \dword{fsi} alter both the momentum and energy of the recoiling particles produced in the final state, and may also alter their identity and multiplicity in the case of inelastic reinteractions (e.g., in a nucleus a hadron may be absorbed, rescattered, or create a secondary hadron).  The \dword{fsi} model implemented in the \dword{genie}, \dword{nuwro}, and \dword{neut} neutrino interaction generators is a semi-classical cascade model (or in the case of \dword{genie}'s $hA$ model a single step scaled model), based on hadron-nucleus and hadron-nucleon scattering data and theoretical corrections.  \dword{gibuu}, another available generator, uses a full particle transport model, including support for off-shell hadrons in the nuclear medium.
ch-nu-osc-11-app-nuint.tex:The interaction model and its variations are implemented in the  \dword{genie} generator.  The fixed version of \dword{genie} used for this report, v2.12.10\footnote{At the time of the development of this report, \dword{genie} 3 had just recently been released (October 15, 2018).  However, at the time of that release, there was no documentation of the tunes, and the code required to implement uncertainties had also not been released; therefore, it was not feasible to use \dword{genie} 3 for this work.}, will not contain all of the possible cross section variations which need to be modeled.  Therefore, the variations in the cross sections to be considered are implemented as some combination of: \dword{genie} weighting parameters (sometimes referred to as ``\dword{genie} knobs''), {\it ad hoc} weights of events which are designed to parameterize uncertainties or cross section corrections currently not implemented within \dword{genie}, and as discrete alternative model comparisons, achieved through alternate generators, alternate \dword{genie} configurations, or custom weightings.
ch-nu-osc-11-app-nuint.tex:Discrete alternative model comparisons are valuable, but are used sparingly in this work due to finite computational resources and ease of interpretation. The approach taken was to identify classes of uncertainties and provide generous uncertainties intended to span a reasonable range of alternate models. Using the alternate model as mock data either provides a closure test, or a mechanism by which to inflate uncertainties. Most of the alternate models in other generators (GiBUU, NEUT and NuWro) or alternate configurations of \dword{genie} are expected to be covered by the uncertainties described here.
ch-nu-osc-11-app-nuint.tex:The default nuclear model in \dword{genie} is a modified global Fermi gas model of the nucleons in the nucleus.  There are significant deficiencies that are known in global Fermi gas models; these include a lack of consistent incorporation of the tails that result from correlations among nuclei, the lack of correlation between location within the nucleus and momentum of the nucleon, an incorrect relationship between momentum and energy of the off-shell, bound nucleon within the nucleus. \dword{genie} modifies the nucleon momentum distribution empirically to account for short-range correlation effects, which populates tails above the Fermi cutoff, but the remainder of these deficiencies persist. Alternate initial state models, such as spectral functions~\cite{Benhar:1994hw,Nieves:2004wx}, the mean field model of GiBUU~\cite{Gallmeister:2016dnq}, or CRPA calculations~\cite{Pandey:2014tza} may provide better descriptions of the nuclear initial state~\cite{Sobczyk:2017mts}.  It is, however, generally impossible to weight predictions from one initial state model to another to compare predictions, and such studies would have to be done with alternate Monte Carlo simulations.
ch-nu-osc-11-app-nuint.tex:An important Fermi gas parameter which enters directly into neutrino energy reconstruction is the binding or removal energy, $E_B$.  This parameter directly affects the transfer of energy to the nucleus.  It cannot be implemented by event weights within the \dword{genie} Fermi gas model, and is implemented by a ``lateral'' shift of lepton energies as a function of neutrino energy and lepton energy, following T2K's implementation. For \dword{genie}, the recommendation from Ref.~\cite{bodek_eb} is to set $E_b$ to $17.8\pm 3$~MeV in neutrino interactions and $21.8\pm 3$~MeV in antineutrino interactions.  Note that these values significant differ from the \dword{genie} default.%\todo{Luke: I am a bit worried about this, I hacked my own version of GENIE to let Eb affect lepton kinematics to produce histograms similar to what we did on T2K, in the current files (2019-01-18) these shifts are included for numu events only and I can quite easily include for numubar/nue and get them in for the next (final) processing... but the effect looks tiny in CAFAna and given that I'm not sure of my implementation, it might be worth explaining this away as a 'GENIE offers no official way to determine the effect of varying the separation energy on the lepton kinematics'?}
ch-nu-osc-11-app-nuint.tex:The extra strength from the ``\minerva tune'' to $2p2h$ is applied in $(q_0,q_3)$ space (where $q_0$ is energy transfer from the leptonic system, and $q_3$ is the magnitude of the three momentum transfer) to fit reconstructed \minerva CC-inclusive data~\cite{Rodrigues:2015hik} in $E_\text{avail}$\footnote{$E_\text{avail}$ is calorimetrically visible energy in the detector, roughly speaking total recoil hadronic energy, less the masses of $\pi^\pm$ and the kinetic energies of neutrons} and $q_3$.  Reasonable fits to \minerva's data are found by attributing the missing strength to any of $2p2h$ from $np$ initial state pairs, $2p2h$ from $nn$ initial state pairs, or $1p1h$ or quasielastic processes.  The default tune uses an enhancement of the $np$ and $nn$ initial strengths in the ratio predicted by the Nieves model, and alternate systematic variation tunes (``MnvTune'' 1-3) attribute the missing strength to the individual hypotheses above. Implementation of the ``MnvTune'' is based on weighting in true $(q_0,q_3)$. The weighting requires \dword{genie}'s Llewelyn-Smith $1p1h$ and Valencia $2p2h$ are used as the base model. To ensure consistency in using these different tunes as freedom in the model, a single systematic parameter is introduced that varies smoothly between applying the $1p1h$ tune at one extreme value to applying the $nn$ tune at the other extreme via the default tune which is used as the central value. The $np$ tune is neglected in this prescription as being the most redundant, in terms of missing energy content of the final state, of the four discrete hypotheses.%\todo{Luke: Is this right? For neutrinos np -> pp which is maximally 'visible' and for anti-neutrinos np -> nn which is maximally invisible, whereas NN intial states must always end up as np final states... being middlingly invisible, but i guess this also depends on the momentum sharing for which we don't have a good model anyway?}
ch-nu-osc-11-app-nuint.tex:\dword{genie}'s prediction for the ratio of $2p2h$ cross-sections in $\text{Ar}^{40}/\text{C}^{12}$ for neutrinos varies slowly with neutrino energy in the DUNE energy range: from $3.76$ at $1$~GeV to $3.64$ at $5$~GeV. The ratio for antineutrino cross sections is consistent with $3.20$ at all DUNE energies. Since the ratio of $A$ for $\text{Ar}^{40}/\text{C}^{12}$ is $3.33$, this is consistent with the ranges suggested above by the measured $pp$ and $np$ pair scaling.  A dedicated study by the SuSA group using their own theoretical model for the relevant MEC process also concludes that the transverse nuclear response (which drives the $\nu-A$ MEC cross section) ratio between $\text{Ca}^{40}$ (the isoscalar nucleus with the same $A$ as $\text{Ar}^{40}$) and $\text{C}^{12}$ is $3.72$ \cite{Amaro:2017eah}. We conclude that we should vary \dword{genie}'s Valencia model based prediction, including the \minerva tune, for $2p2h$ by $\sim 20\%$ to be consistent with the correlated pair scaling values above. This is done independently for neutrino and antineutrino scattering.
ch-nu-osc-11-app-nuint.tex:\dword{genie} uses the Rein-Sehgal model for pion production. Tunes to $D_2$ data have been performed, both by the \dword{genie} collaboration itself and in subsequent re-evaluations~\cite{Rodrigues:2016xjj}; we use the latter tune as our base model. For simplicity of implementation, the `v2.8.2 (no norm.)' results are used here. Ideally the `v2.8.2 (RES)' would have been used, but the practical effect of this choice on the quoted sensitivities is expected to be small.
ch-nu-osc-11-app-nuint.tex:where $R_{1}$ defines the magnitude of the correction function at the intercept, $x_{1}=0.0$. $x_{2}$ is chosen to be $Q^2=0.35\text{ GeV}^2$ so that $R_{2}$ describes the curvature at the centre point of the correction. The fit found $R_1\approx0.3$ and $R_2\approx0.6$. The correction is applied to events with a resonance decay inside the nucleus giving rise to a pion, based on \dword{genie} event information.
ch-nu-osc-11-app-nuint.tex:A template weighting in $(W, Q^2, E_\nu)$ is implemented to cover the differences between the two models as a systematic uncertainty. The weighting also suppresses \dword{genie} 'non-resonant pion production' events (deep inelastic scattering events with $W<1.7\text{ GeV}$) as the new model already includes the non-resonant contribution coherently. At the time of writing, problems in the anti-neutrino prediction of this model had been recently found, and an updated implementation was not available, as a result the weighting is only applied to true muon-neutrino charged-current resonant pion production interactions.
ch-nu-osc-11-app-nuint.tex:Coherent inelastic pion production measurements on carbon are in reasonable agreement with the \dword{genie} implementation of the Berger-Sehgal model~\cite{Mislivec:2017qfz}.  The process has not been measured at high statistics in argon. While coherent interactions provide a very interesting sample for oscillation analyses, they are a very small component of the event rate and selections will depend on the near detector configuration. Therefore we do not provide any evaluation of a systematic uncertainty for this extrapolation or any disagreements between the Berger-Sehgal model and carbon data.
ch-nu-osc-11-app-nuint.tex:\nova oscillation analyses~\cite{nova_2018} have found the need for excursions beyond the default \dword{genie} uncertainties to describe their single pion to deep inelastic scattering (DIS) transition region data.  Following suit, we drop \dword{genie}'s default ``Rv[n,p][1,2]pi'' knobs and instead implement separate, uncorrelated uncertainties for all perturbations of 1, 2, and $\geq 3$ pion final states, CC/NC, neutrinos/anti-neutrinos, and interactions on protons/neutrons, with the exception of CC neutrino 1-pion production, where interactions on protons and neutrons are merged, following \cite{Rodrigues:2016xjj}. This leads to 23 distinct uncertainty channels ([3 pion states] x [n,p] x [nu/anti-nu] x [CC/NC] - 1), all with a value of 50\% for $W \leq 3$ GeV.  For each channel, the uncertainty drops linearly above $W = 3$ GeV until it reaches a flat value of 5\% at $W = 5$ GeV, where external measurements better constrain this process.
ch-nu-osc-11-app-nuint.tex:\dword{genie} includes a large number of final state uncertainties to its $hA$ final state cascade model which are summarized in Table~\ref{table:HadTranspKnobs}.  These uncertainties have been validated in neutrino interactions primarily on light targets such as carbon, but there is very little data available on argon targets.
ch-nu-osc-11-app-nuint.tex:The lack of tests against argon targets is difficult to address directly because there are many possible \dword{fsi} processes that could be varied, but it would nevertheless be a mistake not to put some degree of freedom in the model to address this.
ch-nu-osc-11-app-nuint.tex:The \dword{fsi} uncertainties are parameterized in terms of a effect on the primary experimental observable. The DUNE detectors seek to keep all observed final states as signal samples, so it is natural to consider the effect of a variation on the reconstructed energy.  The DUNE detector will measure a recoil quantity which will need to be mapped to the true energy loss from the leptonic system, or $q_0$.  In the absence of sophisticated particle flow calorimetry\footnote{Such a sophisticated particle flow reconstruction will eventually follow but is not yet available at this stage of the experimental development} a good approximation to the measured recoil energy is the $E_\text{avail}$---the recoil energy less the rest mass of charged pions and the kinetic energy of any produced neutrons. \dword{fsi} will alter the calorimetric factor ($\mathcal{C}_\textsc{f} = E_{avail}/q_0$) by changing the fraction of recoil energy in neutrons and charged pions while preserving the total cross section.
ch-nu-osc-11-app-nuint.tex:The uncertainty parameterization developed here looks at how \dword{fsi} alters $E_{avail}/q_0$ in carbon, and applies an arbitrary 30\% fraction of this shift to the default prediction on argon.  Event weights as a function of $(q_3,q_0,\mathcal{C}_\textsc{f})$ are calculated such that the total cross section in each $(q_3,q_0)$ bin is conserved, while the first and second moments of the $\mathcal{C}_\textsc{f}$ distribution are modified. The shifts are calculated for charged-current events and are split into neutrino/anti-neutrino and further by interaction mode into $1p1h$, $2p2h$, resonant and DIS interactions. In this analysis effect of this parameter is fully correlated between neutrino and anti-neutrino interactions.
