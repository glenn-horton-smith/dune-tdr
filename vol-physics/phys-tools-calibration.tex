%The DUNE \dword{fd} presents a unique challenge for calibration in many ways. Not only because of its size -- the largest \dword{lartpc} ever constructed -- but also because of its depth. It differs both from existing long-baseline neutrino detectors, and existing \dwords{lartpc} (e.g. the deep underground location). While DUNE is expected to have a \dword{lartpc} as ND, DUNE is unlike previous long baseline experiments (MINOS, \dword{nova}) in that the near detector will have significant differences (pile-up, readout) that may make extrapolation of detector characteristics non-trivial.

The DUNE \dword{nd}, which we expect to include a \dword{lartpc}, will also differ from previous experiments (e.g., MINOS and \nova). Pile-up and readout issues  may complicate extrapolation of detector characteristics.

%Like any \dword{lartpc}, DUNE has the great advantage precision tracking and calorimetry, but,  fully exploiting this capability requires a detailed understanding of the detector response. This challenge is driven by the inherently highly convolved detector response model and strong correlations that exist between various calibration quantities. For example, the determination of energy associated to an event of interest will depend on the simulation model, associated calibration parameters, non-trivial correlations between the parameters and spatial and temporal dependence of those parameters. These variations in parameters occur since the detector is not static. Changes can be abrupt (e.g. noise, a broken resistor in the field cage), or ongoing (e.g. exchange of fluid through volume, ion accumulation). 

As for any \lartpc, full exploitation of DUNE's capability for precision tracking and calorimetry requires a detailed understanding of the detector response. The inherently highly convolved detector response model and the strong correlations that exist between various calibration quantities make this challenging. 
For example, the determination of energy associated with an event of interest will depend on the simulation model, associated calibration parameters, non-trivial correlations between the parameters, and spatial and temporal dependence of those parameters caused by the non-static nature of the \dword{fd}. 
Changes can be abrupt (e.g., noise, a broken resistor in the \dword{fc}), or ongoing (e.g., exchange of fluid through volume, ion accumulation).

%A convincing measurement of CP violation, or a resolution of the neutrino mass ordering, or \dword{snb} detection will require a demonstration that the overall detector response is well understood. The systematic uncertainties for the long baseline and low energy (supernova) program will determine how precisely each calibration parameter needs to be measured. In general, the calibration program must provide measurements at the few percent or better level stably across an enormous volume and a long period of time. The calibration strategy must also provide sufficient redundancy in the measurement program. A large portion of the calibration work reported in this chapter is done under the joint \dword{sp} and \dword{dp} calibration task force (CTF) formed in August 2017. A joint \dword{sp} and \dword{dp} calibration consortium has been formed in October 2018 where most of the work related to calibration hardware systems is being done.

%\section{Calibration Strategy}
%\label{sec:phys-calibstrat} 

%DUNE has a broad physics program that includes long baseline neutrino oscillation physics, supernova physics, nucleon decay, and other searches for new physics. The physics processes that lead to the formation of these signals and the detector effects that influence their propagation must be carefully understood in order to perform adequate calibrations, as they ultimately affect the detector's energy response. Several other categories of effects can impact measurements of physical quantities such as the neutrino interaction model or reconstruction pathologies. These other effects are beyond the scope of the \dword{fd} calibration effort and can only amplify the overall error budget. In the remainder of this section, we briefly describe the physics-driven calibration requirements, including the calibration sources and systems required for the different stages of the experiment.

 

\subsection{Physics-driven Calibration Requirements}
\label{sec:phys-calib-req}

To perform adequate calibrations the physics processes that lead to the formation of the signals required for DUNE's broad physics program, and the detector effects that influence their propagation, must be carefully understood, as they ultimately affect the detector's energy response. 
Other categories of effects, such as the neutrino interaction model or reconstruction pathologies, can impact measurements of physical quantities. These other effects are beyond the scope of the \dword{fd} calibration effort and would only lead to a higher overall error budget.

%\textit{\dword{lbl} physics:} In the physics volume of the DUNE CDR~\cite{Acciarri:2015uup}, Figure~3.23 shows that increasing the uncertainties on the \nue event rate from \num{2}\% overall to \num{3}\% results in a \num{50}\% longer run period to achieve a 5$\sigma$ determination of CP violation for 50\% of possible values of \dword{cpv}. The CDR also assumes that the fiducial volume is understood at the 1\% level. Thus, calibration information needs to provide approximately 1-2\% understanding of normalization 
%and position resolution within the detector. Later studies~\cite{ebias} expanded the simple treatment of energy  presented above. In particular, \num{1}\% bias on the lepton energy has a significant impact on the sensitivity to \dword{cpv}. 
%A \num{3}\% bias in the hadronic state (excluding neutrons) is important, as the inelasticity  distribution for neutrinos and antineutrinos is quite different.  A different fraction of the antineutrino's energy will go into the hadronic state. Finally, while studies largely consider a single, absolute energy scale, relative spatial differences across the enormous DUNE \dword{fd} volume will need to be monitored and corrected; this is also true for changes that occur in time. A number of in-situ calibration sources will be required to address these broad range of requirements. Michel electrons, neutral pions and radioactive sources (both intrinsic and external) are needed for calibrating detector response to electromagnetic activity in the tens to hundreds of MeV energy range. Stopping protons and muons from cosmic rays or beam interactions form an important calibration source for calorimetric reconstruction and particle identification. \Dword{protodune}, as a dedicated test beam experiment, provides critical measurements to characterize and validate particle identification strategies in a 1~kt scale detector and will be an essential input to the overall program. Dedicated calibration systems, like lasers, will be useful to provide in-situ full volume measurements of electric field distortions. Measuring the strength and uniformity of the electric field is a key aspect of calibration, as  estimates of calorimetric response and particle identification depend on electric field through recombination. The stringent physics requirements on energy scale and fiducial volume also put similarly stringent requirements on detector physics quantities such as electric field, drift velocity, electron lifetime, and the time dependences of these quantities.

Different fractions of their energies go into the hadronic state. Finally, while studies largely consider a single, absolute energy scale, DUNE will need to monitor and correct relative spatial differences across the enormous DUNE \dword{fd} volume; this is also true for time-dependent changes. 

A number of in situ calibration sources will be required to address these broad range of requirements. 
Michel electrons, neutral pions and radioactive sources (both intrinsic and external) are needed for calibrating detector response to electromagnetic activity in the tens-to-hundreds of MeV energy range. Stopping protons and muons from cosmic rays or beam interactions form an important calibration source for calorimetric reconstruction and particle identification. 
\Dword{protodune}, as a dedicated test beam experiment, provides critical measurements to characterize and validate particle identification strategies in a \SI{1}{kt}-scale detector and is an essential input to the overall program. Dedicated calibration systems, like lasers, will be useful to provide in situ full-volume measurements of \efield distortions. 
Measuring the strength and uniformity of the \efield is a key aspect of calibration, as  estimates of calorimetric response and \dword{pid} depend on the \efield through recombination. The stringent physics requirements on energy scale and fiducial volume also put similarly stringent requirements on detector physics quantities such as \efield, drift velocity, electron lifetime, and the time dependencies of these quantities. 

%\textbf{Supernova burst and low-energy neutrino physics:} For this physics, the signal events present specific reconstruction and calibration challenges and observable energy is shared between different charge clusters and types of energy depositions. Some of the primary requirements here include calibration of absolute energy scale and understanding and improving the nominal 20\% energy resolution, important for resolving spectral features of \dword{snb} events, calibration of time and light yield response of optical photon detectors, absolute timing of events, measurement of trigger efficiency at low energies, and understanding of detector response to radiological backgrounds. Potential calibration sources in this energy range include Michel electrons from muon decays (successfully utilized by ICARUS and \dword{microboone}~\cite{Acciarri:2017sjy}), which have a well known spectrum up to $\sim$50~MeV. Radiological sources provide calibrations of photon, electron, and neutron response for energies below \SI{10}{\MeV}. It is more challenging to find ``standard candles'' between 50~MeV and \SI{100}{\MeV}, beyond cosmic-ray muon energy loss. \Dword{protodune} could potentially be a test bed for various calibration strategies. One can imagine also ancillary studies of detector response using detectors such as LArIAT~\cite{Cavanna:2014iqa}, \dword{microboone}~\cite{Acciarri:2016smi}, and SBND~\cite{Antonello:2015lea}. 
% The ultimate calibration would be using a source of neutrinos from pion decay at rest, such as that available at the Spallation Neutron Source~\cite{Bolozdynya:2012xv}, which have energies up to \SI{50}{\MeV} with a well-understood spectrum. %KM cut, too speculative?

%\textit{\dword{snb} and low-energy neutrino physics:} 
\paragraph{\dword{snb} and low-energy neutrino physics}
These signal events present specific reconstruction and calibration challenges, and observable energy is shared between different charge clusters and types of energy depositions. Primary requirements for this physics include 
(1) calibration of absolute energy scale and an understanding and improvement to the nominal 20\% energy resolution, which is important for resolving spectral features of \dword{snb} events;
(2) calibration of time and light yield response of optical photon detectors;  
(3) absolute timing of events;  
(4) measurement of trigger efficiency at low energies;  and 
(5) understanding of detector response to radiological backgrounds. 
Potential calibration sources in this energy range include Michel electrons from muon decays (successfully utilized by ICARUS and \dword{microboone}~\cite{Acciarri:2017sjy}), which have a well known spectrum up to $\sim\,$\SI{50}{Mev}.

%\textbf{Nucleon decay and other exotic physics:} The calibration needs for nucleon decay and other exotic physics are comparable to the \dword{lbl} program as listed before. Signal channels for light dark matter and sterile neutrino searches will be neutral current interactions that are background to the \dword{lbl} physics program. %The DUNE nucleon decay group has done studies of detection of the proton decay channel \ptoknubar, %$p\rightarrow K+ \overline{\nu}$,  where the kaon decays to a muon, which subsequently decays to a positron. %~\cite{protondecaywidths}. Based on the widths of $dE/dx$-based metrics of particle identification, qualitatively, we need to calibrate $dE/dx$ across all drift and track orientations at the few percent level or better, which is a similar target of interest as the \dword{lbl} effort.

%\textit{Nucleon decay and other exotic physics:} 
\paragraph{Nucleon decay and other exotic physics}
The calibration needs for nucleon decay and other exotic physics are comparable to those for the \dword{lbl} program, as listed in Section~\ref{sec:phys-calib-lbl}. Signal channels for light \dword{dm} and sterile neutrino searches will be \dword{nc} interactions that are background to the \dword{lbl} physics program. 
Based on the widths of $dE/dx$-based metrics of \dword{pid}, qualitatively, we need to calibrate $dE/dx$ across all drift and track orientations at the few-percent level or better, similar to the \dword{lbl} effort.



%\textbf{Calibration sources and systems:} Calibration sources and systems provide measurements of the detector response model parameters, or provide tests of the response model. Calibration measurements can also provide corrections applied to data, data-driven efficiencies, systematics and particle responses. Figure~\ref{fig:calibneeds} shows the broad range of categories of measurements calibrations can provide and lists the critical calibration parameters for DUNE's detector response model applicable to both \dword{sp} or \dword{dp}. Due to the significant interdependencies of many parameters (e.g. recombination, electric field, liquid argon purity), a calibration strategy will either need to iteratively measure parameters, or find sources that break these correlations. Table~\ref{tab:calibsystem} provides a list of various calibration sources and proposed calibration systems along with their primary usage which will comprise the currently envisioned nominal DUNE FD calibration design to adequately address the needs for physics. More details on each of the calibration sources and systems are provided in the next sections. \Dword{protodune} and previous measurements provide independent tests of the response model, where the choice of parameterization and values correctly reproduces real detector data, however not all of the ex situ measurements will be directly extrapolatable to DUNE due to other detector effects and conditions. Only those that are believed to be universal (e.g., argon ionization energy) can be extrapolated. Also, while there are many existing calibration sources, each source comes with its own challenges. For example, electrons from muon decay (Michel electrons) are very useful to study the detector response to low-energy electrons (\SI{50}{\MeV}). However, low-energy electrons present reconstruction challenges due to the loss of charge from radiative photons as demonstrated in \dword{microboone}~\cite{Acciarri:2017sjy}. In terms of source category, Michel electrons are considered as an important, independent, and necessary test of the TPC energy response model, and not as a measurement of a particular response parameter.

\subsection{A Staged Approach}
\label{sec:phys-calib-approach}

%% Directly from IDR %%

%The calibration strategy for DUNE will need to address the evolving operational and physics needs at every stage of the experiment in a timely manner using the primary sources and systems listed in Table~\ref{tab:calibsystem}. At the \dword{tdr} stage, a clear and complete calibration strategy with necessary studies will need to be provided to demonstrate how the existing sources and dedicated systems meet the physics requirements.  In this TDR, the baseline calibration systems and strategy are presented. Post-TDR, once the calibration strategy is set, necessary designs for calibration hardware along with tools and methods to be used with various calibration sources will need to be developed. To allow for flexibility in this process, the physical interfaces for calibration such as flanges or ports on the cryostat should be designed for a wide range of possible uses to accommodate the calibration hardware. As described in the \dword{sp} detector volume of calibration, the Calibration task force has made necessary accommodations for calibration systems for the \dword{spmod} in terms of feedthrough penetration design and will soon finalize the same for the \dword{dpmod}.

As DUNE physics turns on at different rates and times, a calibration strategy at each stage for physics and data taking is required. This strategy described in this section assumes that all systems are commissioned and deployed according to the nominal DUNE run plan.

%\textbf{Commissioning:} When the detector is filled, data from various instrumentation devices will be needed to validate the argon fluid flow model and purification system. When the detector is filled and at the desired high voltage, the detector immediately becomes live for supernovae and proton decay signals (beam and atmospheric neutrino physics will require a few years of data accumulation) at which stage it is critical for early calibration to track the space-time dependence of the detector. Noise data (taken with wires off) and pulser data (taken with signal calibration pulses injected into electronics) will be needed to understand the detector electronics response. Essential systems at this stage include temperature monitors, purity monitors, HV monitors, robust front-end charge injection system for cold electronics, and a PDS monitoring system. Additionally, as the $^{39}$Ar data will be available immediately, readiness (in terms of reconstruction tools and methods) to utilize $^{39}$Ar decays will be needed, both for understanding low energy response and space-time uniformity. External calibration systems as listed in Table~\ref{tab:calibsystem} will be deployed and commissioned at this stage and commissioning data from these systems will be needed to verify expected configuration for each system and any possible adjustments needed to tune for data taking.
\textit{Commissioning:} When a \dword{detmodule} is filled, data from various instrumentation devices validate the argon fluid flow model and purification system. Once filled and at the desired high voltage, the \dword{detmodule} immediately becomes live for \dword{snb} and proton decay signals (beam and atmospheric neutrino physics will require a few years of data accumulation)
%\fixme{isn't it more like the beam won't turn on at the same time? Once the beam turns on, the detector is live. And why wouldn't it begin to collect data for atmosph nu's? anne; SG: the detector is live right after it is at desired voltage and start collecting cosmics, atmospherics, SNB events etc. With beam turn on, there is beam data taken; can clarify to Anne more verbally}
at which point it is critical that early calibration track the space-time dependence of the detector. Noise data 
%(taken with wires off) 
%\fixme{wires off? not clear. anne; SG: too much detail, taken out} 
and pulser data (taken with signal calibration pulses injected into the electronics) are needed to understand the TPC electronics response. Essential systems at this stage include temperature monitors, purity monitors, \dword{hv} monitors, robust \dword{fe} charge injection system for cold electronics, and a \dword{pds} monitoring system. 
In addition, as the $^{39}$Ar data is available immediately, DUNE must be ready (in terms of reconstruction tools and methods) to utilize $^{39}$Ar decays for understanding both low-energy response and space-time uniformity. 
Dedicated calibration systems as listed in Table~\ref{tab:calibsystem} are deployed and commissioned at this stage. Commissioning data from these systems must verify the expected configuration for each system and identify any needed adjustments to tune for data taking.

%\textbf{Early data taking:} Since DUNE will not have all in-situ measurements of liquid argon properties at this stage, early calibration of the detector will utilize liquid argon physical properties from \Dword{protodune} or SBND, and \efield{}s from calculations tuned to measured HV. This early data will most likely need to be recalibrated at a later stage when other data sets become available. This is expected to improve from in-situ measurements as data taking progresses and with dedicated calibration runs. The detector response models in simulation will need to be tuned on \Dword{protodune} and\slash or SBND data during this early phase, and the mechanism for performing this tuning needs to be ready. This, together with cosmic ray muon analysis, will provide an approximate energy response model that can be used for early physics. Analysis of cosmic ray muon data to develop methods and tools for muon reconstruction from MeV to TeV and a well-validated cosmic ray event generator with data will be essential for early physics. %Cosmic ray or beam induced muon tracks tagged with an external muon tracker system, if deployed, will be very useful in these early stages to independently measure and benchmark muon reconstruction performance and efficiencies in the FD. 
%Dedicated early calibration runs from external calibration systems will be needed to develop and tune calibration tools to beam data taking and correct for any space-time irregularities observed in the TPC system for early physics. Given the expected low rate of cosmic ray events at the underground location (see Section~\ref{sec:phys-calib-sources}), calibration with cosmic rays are not possible over short time scales and will proceed from coarse-grained to fine-grained over the course of years as statistics is accumulated. The experiment will have to rely on external systems such as laser for calibrations that require an independent probe with reduced or removed interdependencies, fine-grained measurements (both in space and time) and detector stability monitoring in the time scales needed for physics. Additionally some measurements are not possible with cosmic rays (e.g. APA flatness or global alignment of all APAs). External systems such as radioactive sources or neutron injection sources will provide low energy EM response at the precision required for low energy supernovae physics. 
\textit{Early data taking:} Since DUNE will not yet have all in situ measurements of \lar physical properties at this stage, early calibration of the detector will use \lar measurements from \dword{protodune} or SBND, and \efield{}s from calculations tuned to measured \dword{hv} values.
This early data will most likely need to be recalibrated at a later stage with dedicated calibration runs when in situ measurements are available and as data taking progresses. It will be necessary to tune the detector response models in the simulation on \Dword{protodune} or SBND data during this early phase, requiring that the mechanism for performing this tuning be ready. 
This, together with cosmic ray muon analysis, will provide an approximate energy-response model to use for early physics. The early physics will also require analysis of cosmic ray muon data to develop methods and tools for muon reconstruction from MeV to TeV and a well validated cosmic ray event generator with data. 
Dedicated early calibration runs using calibration hardware systems will develop and tune calibration tools to beam data taking and correct for any space-time irregularities observed in the TPC. Given the expected low rate of cosmic ray events at the underground location (see Section~\ref{sec:phys-calib-sources}), calibration with cosmic rays is not possible over short time scales and will proceed from coarse-grained to fine-grained over the course of years, as statistics accumulate. 
The experiment will rely on calibration hardware systems, such as a laser system, for calibrations that require an independent probe with reduced or removed interdependencies, fine-grained measurements (both in space and time), and detector stability monitoring on the time scales required by physics. Some measurements are simply not possible with cosmic rays (e.g., \dword{apa} flatness, global alignment of all \dword{apa}s). Calibration systems such as radioactive sources or neutron-injection sources will provide low-energy electromagnetic response at the precision required for low-energy \dword{snb} physics. 

%\textbf{Stable operations:} Once the detector is under stable running, dedicated calibration runs, ideally before, during and after each run period, will be needed to ensure detector conditions have not significantly changed. As statistics are accumulated, standard candle data samples (e.g. Michel electrons and neutral pions) both from cosmic rays, beam induced and atmospheric neutrinos can be used to validate and improve the detector response models needed for precision physics. As DUNE becomes systematics limited, dedicated calibration campaigns using the external calibration systems will become crucial for precision calibration to meet the stringent physics requirements both for energy scale reconstruction and detector resolution. For example, understanding electromagnetic (EM) response in the FD will require both cosmic rays and external systems such as radioactive or neutron injection source systems as mentioned before. The very high energy muons from cosmic rays at that depth that initiate EM showers %(which would be rare at \Dword{protodune} or SBND), will provide information to study EM response at high energies. Other calibration needs not addressed with existing sources and external systems, will be determined initially from the output of the \Dword{protodune} and\slash or SBND program, and later from the DUNE ND. Studies described in Section~\ref{sec:phys-calib-devplan} as part of the calibration development plan may also result in realization of additional systems that may be deployed in DUNE.

%The nominal calibration design includes existing sources, external measurements, monitors,  and dedicated calibration systems. The dedicated systems include a laser system, a neutron-injection system and a radioactive source deployment system. The dedicated systems are motivated as they supply necessary information beyond the reach of the external measurements,  existing sources, and monitors.

\subsubsection{Existing sources} 
\label{sec:phys-calib-exis}
%Cosmic rays and neutrino-induced interactions provide commonly used ``standard candles'' like electrons from muon and pion decays, and neutral pions, which have characteristic energy spectra. Cosmic ray muons are also used to determine detector element locations (alignment), timing offsets or drift velocity, electron lifetime, and channel-by-channel response, and help constrain electric field distortions. The rates for cosmic-ray events are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:cosmic-ray-calib-rates}, and certain measurements (e.g. channel-to-channel gain uniformity and cathode panel alignment) are estimated to take several months of data. The rates for atmospheric $\nu$ interactions can be found in Table~\ref{tab:atmnu-rates} \todo{this is Table 1.3 in the non-accelerator physics chapter of the physics volume, need to link it} and are comparable to beam-induced events; both atmospheric and beam induced interactions do not have sufficient rates to provide meaningful spatial or temporal calibration and are expected to provide supplemental measurements only. Also, beam neutrinos may not contribute to the first module calibration during early data taking as the beam is expected to arrive later. The reconstructed energy spectrum of ${}^{39}$Ar beta decays can be used to make a precise measurement of electron lifetime with spatial and temporal variations. It can also provide other necessary calibrations, such as measurements of wire-to-wire response variations and diffusion measurements using the signal shapes associated with the beta decays. The ${}^{39}$Ar beta decay rate in commercially-provided argon is about \SI{1}{\becquerel\per\kilo\gram}, so $O(\mathrm{50k})$ ${}^{39}$Ar beta decays are expected in a single \SI{5}{\milli\s} event readout in an entire \SI{10}{\kt} \detmodule. The ${}^{39}$Ar beta decay cut-off energy is \SI{565}{\keV} which is close to the energy deposited on a single wire by a \dword{mip}. However, there are several factors that can impact the observed charge spectrum from ${}^{39}$Ar beta decays such as electronics noise, electron lifetime and recombination fluctuations. This technique is currently being actively pursued in MicroBooNE~\cite{MICROBOONE-NOTE-1050-PUB} and ProtoDUNE thus providing valuable inputs for DUNE.
Cosmic rays and neutrino-induced interactions provide commonly used ``standard candles,'' e.g., electrons from muon and pion decays, and neutral pions, which have characteristic energy spectra. Cosmic ray muons are also used to determine detector element locations (alignment), timing offsets or drift velocity, electron lifetime, and channel-by-channel response, and to help constrain \efield distortions. 
Table~\ref{tab:cosmic-ray-calib-rates} summarizes the rates for cosmic ray events. Certain measurements (e.g., channel-to-channel gain uniformity and cathode panel alignment) are estimated to take several months of data. Table~\ref{tab:atmos_rates} gives the atmospheric $\nu$ interaction rates, which  
%\todo{this is Table 1.3 in the non-accelerator physics chapter of the physics volume, need to link it. Anne put it in.} 
 are comparable to beam-induced events -- neither occurs at sufficient rates to provide meaningful spatial or temporal calibration; they will likely provide supplemental measurements only. (The beam will not yet be operational for calibration of the first \dword{detmodule} during early data taking.) Instead, we can use the reconstructed energy spectrum of ${}^{39}$Ar beta decays to make a precise measurement of electron lifetime with spatial and temporal variations. 
 This can also provide other necessary calibrations, such as measurements of wire-to-wire response variations and diffusion measurements using the signal shapes associated with the beta decays. The ${}^{39}$Ar beta decay rate in commercially-provided argon is about \SI{1}{\becquerel\per\kilo\gram}, so $O(\mathrm{50k})$ ${}^{39}$Ar beta decays are expected in a single \SI{5}{\milli\s} event readout in an entire \nominalmodsize \detmodule. 
 The ${}^{39}$Ar beta decay cutoff energy is \SI{565}{\keV},  which is close to the energy deposited on a single wire by a \dword{mip}.

\subsubsection{Monitors} 
%Several instrumentation and detector monitoring devices discussed in detail in Chapter 8 of \voltitlesp{} and \voltitledp{} of the \dword{tdr} will provide valuable information for early calibrations and to track the space-time dependence of the detector. The instrumentation devices include liquid argon temperature monitors, \lar purity monitors, gaseous argon analyzers, cryogenic (cold) and inspection (warm) cameras, and liquid level monitors. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations play a key role for calibrations initially in the design of the cryogenics recirculation system, and later for physics studies when the cryogenics instrumentation data is used to validate the simulations.

\subsubsection{External measurements} 
%External measurements here include both past measurements (e.g., ArgoNeuT, DUNE \dword{35t}, ICARUS, \lariat), anticipated measurements from ongoing and future experiments (e.g., \dword{microboone}, SBND, \dword{protodune}) as well as from small scale \dword{lartpc} test stands. External measurements provide a test bed for dedicated calibration hardware systems and techniques which are applicable to the DUNE FD. In particular, \dword{protodune} will provide validation of the fluid flow model using instrumentation data. Early calibration for physics in DUNE will utilize liquid argon physical properties from \Dword{protodune} or SBN  for tuning detector response models in simulation. Table~\ref{tab:calibsystem} provides  references for specific external measurements. The usability of ${}^{39}$Ar has been demonstrated with \microboone data~\cite{MICROBOONE-NOTE-1050-PUB}. 
%Use of  ${}^{39}$Ar  and other radiological sources, including the DAQ readout challenges associated with their use, will be tested on the \dword{protodune} detectors. Dedicated systems for DUNE, including the laser system, have been used by previous experiments (ARGONTUBE~\cite{Zeller:2013sva}, \dword{Ereditato:2014aa}, CAPTAIN, and SBND experiments), and will provide increased information of the use of the system and optimization of the design. Measurements from small-scale liquid argon test stands can also provide valuable information for DUNE. The liquid argon test stand planned at Brookhaven National Lab will provide important information for how field response is simulated and calibrated at DUNE.

\subsubsection{Dedicated Calibration Hardware Systems}
\label{sec:phys-calib-hardware}
%This section briefly describes the physics motivation and measurement goals for the external calibration hardware systems along with a brief description of the designs currently envisioned. Further details on the design and development plan for these systems can be found in the calibration chapters in the \voltitlesp{} and \voltitledp{} of the \dword{tdr}. For all the systems listed here, the goal is to deploy Prototype designs in a potential phase 2 of ProtoDUNE to demonstrate proof of principle before they are installed in the FD.

We plan to deploy prototype designs of these systems in a potential phase 2 of \dword{protodune} to demonstrate proof-of-principle.

\textbf{Laser systems} 

%The primary purpose of a laser system is to provide an independent, fine-grained estimate of the \efield in space or time, which is a critical parameter for physics signals as it ultimately impacts the spatial resolution and energy response of the detector. External measurements, such as MicroBooNE, use both laser and copious cosmic rays to estimate the \efield, but the expected cosmic rate at DUNE does not provide sufficient spatial or temporal granularity to probe distortions of interest or unforeseen ones. 
The primary purpose of a laser system is to provide an independent, fine-grained estimate of the \efield in space or time, which is a critical parameter for physics signals as it ultimately impacts the spatial resolution and energy response of the detector. External measurements, e.g.,  MicroBooNE's, use both a laser system and cosmic rays to estimate the \efield, however the expected cosmic rate at the deep underground installation of the \dword{fd} will not provide sufficient spatial or temporal granularity to be useful.

%There are multiple sources which may distort the electric field temporally or spatially in the detector. Current simulation studies indicate that positive ion accumulation and drift (space charge) due to ionization sources such as cosmic rays or ${}^{39}$Ar is small in the DUNE \dword{fd}; however, not enough is known yet about the fluid flow pattern in the FD to exclude the possibility of stable eddies which may amplify the effect for both \single and \dual modules. This effect can get further amplified significantly in \dword{dpmod} due to ion accumulation at the liquid-gas interface. 
%Additionally, other sources in the detector (especially detector imperfections) can cause \efield distortions. For example, field cage resistor failures, non-uniform resistivity in the voltage dividers, CPA misalignment, CPA structural deformations, and APA and CPA offsets and  deviations from flatness can create localized \efield distortions. Each individual \efield distortion may add in quadrature with other effects, and can reach 4\% under certain conditions. Understanding all these effects require in-situ measurement of \efield for proper calibration. Many useful secondary uses of laser include alignment (especially modes that are weakly constrained by cosmic rays), stability monitoring, and diagnosing detector failures (e.g., \dword{hv}).  
\efield distortions can arise from multiple sources. Current simulation studies indicate that positive ion accumulation and drift (space charge) due to ionization sources such as cosmic rays or ${}^{39}$Ar are small in the \dword{fd}; however, the fluid flow pattern in the \dword{fd} is not yet sufficiently understood to exclude the possibility of stable eddies that may amplify the effect for both \single and \dual modules. The \dword{dpmod} risks significant further amplification due to ion accumulation at the liquid-gas interface. 
Detector imperfections can also cause localized \efield distortions. Examples include \dword{fc} resistor failures, non-uniform resistivity in the voltage dividers, \dword{cpa} misalignment, \dword{cpa} structural deformations, and \dword{apa} and \dword{cpa} offsets and  deviations from flatness. Individual \efield distortions may add in quadrature with other effects, and can reach 4\% under certain conditions. Understanding all these effects requires proper in situ calibration of the \efield{}. 

The laser calibration system offers secondary uses, e.g., alignment (especially modes that are weakly constrained by cosmic rays), stability monitoring, and diagnosing detector failures in systems such as \dword{hv}.

%Two laser-based systems have been considered to extract the electric field map: photoelectrons from the \lartpc cathode and direct ionization of the \dword{lar}, both driven by a \SI{266}{\nano\m} laser.  The reference design from \dword{microboone} and SBND experiments uses direct ionization laser light with multiple laser paths. This can provide field map information in $(x, y, z, t)$; \phel laser only provides integral field across the drift.

The deviation from straightness of single ``laser tracks'' can also be used to constrain local \efield{}s.

%A \phel{}-based calibration system was used in the T2K gaseous (predominantly Ar), TPCs~\cite{Abgrall:2010hi}.
%Thin metal surfaces placed at surveyed positions on the cathode provided point-like and line sources of \phel{}s when illuminated by a laser.

For DUNE, the system would be similarly used as on T2K to diagnose electronics or TPC response issues on demand, and provide an integral field measurement and relative distortions of $y$, $z$ positions with time, and of either $x$ or drift velocity.

\textbf{Pulsed neutron source} 

%An external neutron generator system would provide a triggered, well defined energy deposition from neutron capture in $^{40}$Ar that can be detected throughout the volume. Neutron capture is a critical component of signal processes for \dword{snb} and \dword{lbl} physics; this system enables direct testing of the response of the detector spatially and temporally for the low energy program.

Neutron capture is a critical component of signal processes for \dword{snb} and \dword{lbl} physics; this system would enable direct testing of the detector response  spatially and temporally for the low-energy program. 

%A triggered pulse of neutrons can be generated outside the TPC, then injected into the \dword{lar}, where it spreads through the entire volume to produce mono-energetic a cascade of photons via the $^{40}$Ar(n,$\gamma$)$^{41}$Ar capture process. The uniform population of neutrons throughout the detector module volume exploits a remarkable property of argon -- the near transparency to neutrons with an energy near \SI{57}{\keV} due to a deep minimum in the cross section caused by the destructive interference between two high-level states of the \isotope{Ar}{40} nucleus. This cross section ``anti-resonance'' is about \SI{10}{\keV} wide, and 57 keV neutrons consequently have a scattering length of 859 m; the scattering length averaged over the isotopic abundance in natural Ar is approximately 30~m. For neutrons moderated to this energy the DUNE \dword{lartpc} is essentially transparent. The 57 keV neutrons that do scatter quickly leave the anti-resonance and thermalize, at which time they capture. Each neutron capture releases exactly the binding energy difference between \isotope{Ar}{40} and \isotope{Ar}{41}, about \SI{6.1}{\MeV} in the form of gamma rays. In Nov 2017, the ACED~\cite{aced-svoboda} Collaboration took several hundred thousand neutron capture events at the DANCE\cite{Reifarth:2013xny} facility at LANSCE which are currently being analyzed to characterize neutron capture gamma spectrum.

\textbf{Radioactive source system}

%Radioactive source deployment provides an in-situ source of the electrons and de-excitation gamma rays, which are directly relevant for physics signals from supernova or $^{8}B$ solar neutrinos. Secondary measurements from the source deployment include electromagnetic (EM) shower characterization for long-baseline $\nu_e$ CC events, electron lifetime as a function of \dword{detmodule} vertical position, and help determine radiative components of the electron energy spectrum from muon decays.

%A composite source can be used that consists of $^{252}$Cf, a strong neutron emitter, and $^{58}$Ni, which, via the $^{58}$Ni(n,$\gamma$)$^{59}$Ni process, converts one of the $^{252}$Cf decay neutrons, suitably moderated, to a mono-energetic 9 MeV photon~\cite{Rogers:1996ks}. The source is envisaged to be inside a cylindrical teflon moderator such that it can be deployed using one of the instrumentation ports. The activity of the radioactive source is chosen such that no more than one \SI{9}{\MeV} capture $\gamma$-event occurs during a single drift period. This allows one to use the arrival time of the measured light as a $t0$ and then measure the average drift time of the corresponding charge signal(s). The sources would be deployed outside the \dword{fc} within the cryostat and would be removed and stored outside the cryostat when not in use. The design and deployment of radioactive source calibration system for the DUNE FD is currently being studied actively by the calibration consortium.

\subsubsection{Calibration Development Plan}
\label{sec:phys-calib-devplan}
\fixme{{\bf placeholder:} Update with studies by the final TDR deadline}

%\fixme{This top pgraph moved up from bottom of section, and split into 3 by anne}
Studies are underway to clarify the physics use limitations of the existing sources presented in Section~\ref{sec:phys-calib-exis}:
\begin{itemize}
\item The relative importance of electromagnetic shower photons below pair production threshold and quantifying what can be achieved for both electron lifetime measurements and the overall energy-scale calibration from cosmic rays, ${}^{39}$Ar beta decays, \dword{lbl} interactions and atmospheric neutrinos is being determined, in terms of spatial and temporal granularity using decay electrons and $\pi^0$ samples. We expect that combining information from cosmic ray events with proposed and existing systems (laser-based, neutrino-induced events, and dedicated muon systems) will reduce the total uncertainties on misalignment.  

\item The impact of misalignments on the physics case is being studied, especially for alignment modes that are weakly constrained due to cosmic ray direction, including global shifts and rotations of all detector elements, as well as crumpling modes where the edges of the \dwords{apa} hold together but angles are slightly different from nominal. Misalignment can be studied in two steps: 1. using a parameterization in the simulation that produces distorted muons which can then be reconstructed using nominal reconstruction to study impact on the multiple-coloumb scattering (MCS) momentum measurement. 2. constrain all of the APA (and CPA) locations with cosmic rays and apply these as alignment constants during reconstruction so that downstream algorithms are minimally impacted by misalignment. The second step is what the end goal is for the operating far detector. The motivation for step 1 is to estimate the impact on the physics of residual uncorrected misalignment once the second step is done.

%The impact of misalignment on physics can be studied in two steps: 1. a parameterization is needed to estimate the impact of misalignment on the physics. This can be done using what is called a charge drift distortion service that the simulation module can use to produce distorted simulation. The plan is to reconstruct distorted muons with nominal reconstruction and see if it distorts the multiple-coloumb scattering (MCS) momentum measurement. 2. The second step is what the end goal is for the operating far detector. We would like to constrain all of the APA (and CPA) locations with cosmic rays and apply these as alignment constants to the reconstruction step so that downstream algorithms are minimally impacted by misalignment. The reason for doing the first step is to estimate the impact on the physics of residual uncorrected misalignment once the second step is done.

\item The impact of the fluid model on physics needs requires quantification through \dword{cfd} simulations (e.g., overall temperature variation in the cryostat and impact on drift velocity, overall impurity variation across the \detmodule{}, and impact on energy scale especially for \dword{dp}, which has a \SI{12}{\m} long single drift path). The \dword{cfd} studies will also be important for understanding how \lar flow can impact space charge from both ionization and non-ionization sources, and ion accumulation (both positive and negative), separately for the \dword{spmod} and \dword{dpmod} designs. 

%\item Simulation tools to quantify \efield distortions from various sources are being developed to study impact on physics. Maps of electric field distortions are produced from expectations for both ionization (e.g. cosmic rays, ${}^{39}$Ar) and non-ionization sources (e.g. deformations of \dword{hv} components) and are propagated in simulation with appropriate knobs to turn on\slash off the spatial and recombination effects~\cite{MICROBOONE-NOTE-1050-PUB}. The former arises as \efield distorts the reconstructed positions of ionization electron clusters detected by the TPC wire planes and the latter arises due to the dependence of electron-ion recombination on \efield.
\end{itemize}

%As part of the calibration development plan, additional systems are being explored for the DUNE FD. One of the primary systems that is currently being investigated by the calibration group is the utility of internal source injection (e.g. ${}^{222}$Rn or ${}^{220}$Rn injection) for mapping electron lifetime and fluid flow in the TPC. Initial considerations and challenges for such a system include  efficiency\slash coverage of PDS impacting the ability to tag t$_{0}$ for such events, and the visibility of signal and triggering relative to the massive amount of ${}^{39}$Ar present in the detector. These are currently being studied by the calibration group. The presence of radioactive impurities can also impact such a system. This concern will be addressed within the newly formed DUNE FD Background Task Force. As this system does not require any cryostat penetrations or major \dword{daq} requirements, no accommodations will need to be made for this system.

Beyond the dedicated calibration systems described in earlier sections, the calibration consortium is exploring additional systems for the \dword{fd}:
\begin{itemize}
\item The consortium is also exploring an external muon tagger (EMT) system. A dedicated fast-tracking EMT system would provide track position, direction, and time information independent of the TPC and \dword{pds}. Rock muons from beam interactions in the rock surrounding the \dwords{detmodule} have similar energy  and angular  spectra as \dword{cc} \numu events and an EMT covering the front face of the detector can tag these muons. 

\item The utility of internal source injection (e.g., ${}^{222}$Rn or ${}^{220}$Rn injection) for mapping electron lifetime and fluid flow in the TPC is currently under investigation.  Initial considerations and challenges for such a system include impacts to the efficiency and coverage of the \dword{pds} and its ability to tag $t_{0}$, and the visibility of signal and triggering relative to the massive amount of ${}^{39}$Ar present. Recognizing that the presence of radioactive impurities can also impact such a system, the newly formed DUNE \dword{fd} Background Task Force will address this concern. This system would not require any cryostat penetrations or affect major \dword{daq} requirements.
\end{itemize}

%An external muon tagger (EMT) system is another system that is currently being explored. A dedicated fast tracking EMT system would provide track position, direction, and time information independent of TPC and PDS systems. Rock muons from beam interactions in the rock surrounding the cryostat have similar energy  and angular  spectrum as CC \numu events. A nominal design of the EMT would cover the front face of the detector (approximately $14\textrm{m} \times 12\textrm{m}$) to provide an estimate of the initial position, and the time for a subset of these events, independent of the TPC and PDS systems. A second, similarly sized panel, \SI{1}{\m} away from the cryostat would provide directional information. Additional measurements are possible elsewhere in the detector if the system is portable; it could be positioned on top of the cryostat to capture (nearly downward-going) cosmic ray particles during commissioning, or positioned along the side for rock muon-induced tracks along the drift direction. Optimization of EMT size and pixelization, possible cost-saving options including re-use of existing scintillators (e.g. MINOS) or counter systems (e.g., \dword{protodune} or SBN), and the available space for the EMT around the cryostat are currently being investigated by the calibration group.

Rock muons from beam interactions in the rock surrounding the \dwords{detmodule} have similar energy  and angular  spectra as \dword{cc} \numu events.

A second, similarly sized panel, \SI{1}{\m} away from the cryostat would provide directional information. Additional measurements are possible elsewhere around a \dword{detmodule} if the system is portable.

%Studies are also underway to clarify the physics use limitations of the various existing sources presented in Section~\ref{sec:phys-calib-exis}. For example, determining the relative importance of electromagnetic shower photons below pair production threshold and quantification of what can be achieved for electron lifetime measurements and the overall energy scale calibration from cosmic rays, ${}^{39}$Ar beta decays, long baseline interactions and atmospheric neutrinos, in terms of spatial and temporal granularity using decay electrons, $\pi^0$ samples. It is expected that combinations of information from cosmic-ray events with dedicated and existing systems (laser-based, neutrino-induced events, and dedicated muon systems) will reduce the total uncertainties on misalignment.  The impact of misalignments on the physics case needs to be studied, especially for alignment modes which are weakly constrained due to cosmic ray direction, including global shifts and rotations of all detector elements, and crumpling modes where the edges of the \dwords{apa} hold together but angles are slightly different from nominal. The impact of the fluid model on physics needs require quantification through \dword{cfd} simulations (e.g., overall temperature variation in the cryostat and impact on drift velocity; overall impurity variation across the \detmodule{}, and impact on energy scale especially for \dword{dp} which has a \SI{12}{\m} long single drift path). The CFD studies will also be important in understanding how \lar flow can impact space charge from both ionization and non-ionization sources and ion accumulation (both positive and negative ions), separately for \dword{spmod} and \dword{dpmod} designs.

\subsection{Summary and Future Plans}
\label{sec:phys-calib-sum}

\fixme{{\bf placeholder:} Currently very generic; update with specific conclusions once studies converge}

The physics requirements for the broad DUNE physics program places stringent requirements on calibration systems and sources. DUNE has identified the dedicated calibration systems discussed in section~\ref{sec:phys-calib-hardware} as important to its physics program. The calibration consortium will develop and test the full designs of the these systems as well as develop plans for \dword{daq}, costing, risk mitigation, integration and installation efforts. The multi-purpose ports on the \dword{fd} cryostats enable deployment of additional calibrations systems in the future.
%The formation of the calibration consortium in October 2018 was a major step forward in terms of developing and testing the full designs of the external hardware systems discussed in Section~\ref{sec:phys-calib-hardware} as well as developing plans for \dword{daq}, costing, risk mitigation, integration and installation efforts. 

As presented in Section~\ref{sec:phys-calib-devplan} the calibration task force is developing the necessary tools and techniques in collaboration with other physics groups to propagate detector physics effects into the physics analyses and is studying the impact of calibrations on DUNE physics at a preliminary level. The task force will further improve and expand upon
these studies in the near future as tools and techniques continue to mature.
