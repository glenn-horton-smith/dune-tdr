%\fixme{JM: Done; SG/KM: take a look}

Table~\ref{tab:calib-sched} shows the schedule and key milestones for the calibration consortium leading to commissioning of the first \dword{fd} module. The demonstration of calibration systems design, operation and performance at the ProtoDUNE-SP-II running is also a key part of calibration schedule and those milestones are also listed in the table. The technology design decisions on calibration subsystems is expected to be made by January 2020 for the laser system and March 2020 for the neutron source system followed by technical design reviews. The production of design prototypes to be deployed at ProtoDUNE-SP-II running is expected to be finished by February 2021 followed by assembly and deployment in ProtoDUNE-SP in March 2021. The Radioactive Source Deployment System (RSDS) design will follow a demonstration R\&D program outlined in detail in Table~\ref{tab:calib-rsds-sched}, with major milestones highlighted in this section. The major steps for the systems approval are the design review in May 2020 and the deployment test at ProtoDUNE-SP-II in April 2022. 

The production of calibration systems for the FD is expected to start in March 2022 followed by assembly of systems underground once the detector cavern is available in early 2023. Installation of the laser system can partly start as soon as cryostat roof is accessible, and follow once the TPC is ready for installation. If approved, installation of the RSDS guide system starts just prior to the TPC installation, and the purge-boxes on top of the cryostat can be done later.
The installation of the main components of the PNS will start only after the human access ports are not needed anymore for TPC installation, in June 2025. 

%Table~\ref{tab:pnssched} shows the milestones for the Pulsed Neutron System. \fixme{The laser system schedule will look similar to the pulsed neutron source-- but we need to confirm the TCO closing/installation period before filling in a table for it.}
