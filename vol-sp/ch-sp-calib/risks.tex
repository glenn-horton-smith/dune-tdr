%\section{Risks}

Tables~\ref{tab:fdgen-calib-risks1} to \ref{tab:fdgen-calib-risks3} list the possible risks identified by the calibration consortium along with corresponding mitigation strategies. 
%The table list ?? risks at low and medium level. 
A more detailed list of risks with additional descriptions is currently under development. The tables show all risks are medium or low level, mitigated with necessary steps and precautions. The largest risk is the first one listed, where the \dword{pdsp}-tested designs are inadequate for \dword{fd}; this is important because this requires early validation from \dword{protodune} data so R\&D of alternate designs and/or improvements can be done in a timely manner.

No. & Risk  & Risk Level & Mitigation Strategy  \\ \toprowrule
1 & The baseline design for calibration devices is not adequate for the \dword{fd}. & M & This should be detected early on such that R\&D on alternative designs can proceed on a reasonable time scale. In addition, the cryostat ports have been designed to be multipurpose to enable deployment of new systems if they are developed. \\ \colhline

2 & Elements of the calibration system fail engineering requirements, such as laser beam divergence, and precision of the mechanical system. & L & Although not under identical conditions/apparatus, the same designs envisioned for the FD will be tested in dedicated lab tests and \dword{pdsp}, to identify these issues and mitigate them.
\\ \colhline

3 & The laser light can impact the \dword{pds} system. & M & The mirror movement controller must avoid the beam directly hitting the \dword{pds}. The laser electrical system must allow the latter implementation of a hardware interlock if that is found to be necessary. \\ \colhline

4 & The laser positioning system stops working. & L & Pre-fill QC will be carried out. A possible alternative way to obtain an absolute measurement is to use reflections off of the aluminum FC  profiles, with a very slow angular scan.\\ \colhline

5 & The laser beam becomes misaligned with the mirror sequence. & M & The system includes a visible (red) laser specifically for the purpose of alignment. If the misalignment is not just with the warm mirrors, but also with the cold ones, cryostat cameras might be needed to check arrival of red light to the TPC.\\ \colhline

%While DD Generators produce neutrons with relatively modest fluxes and most materials do not have significant activation (which is why they are typically not used for activation studies), it is prudent to have actual measurements of the activation of materials in the vicinity of the PNS to be able to predict accurately the long-term activation. We propose to use the UC Berkeley DD Generator facility in the Advanced Technology and Innovation Laboratory (ATIL) to exposure cryostat materials to many orders of DD flux (2.45 MeV) than they will see from the PNS over the lifetime of DUNE. ATIL will let us use their facility for a small charge, and results will be used to ensure no long-term significant activation will occur. 

%The scattering length at the $^{40}Ar$ $57\; keV$ anti-resonance has been theoretically calculated to be $1400\; m$, but since argon is 0.0629\% $^{38}Ar$ and 0.3336\% $^{36}Ar$ with scattering lengths of $542\; m$ and $33\; m$ respectively, the overall scattering length of $30 \;m$ does not depend significantly on the exact depth of the anti-resonance. Nevertheless, it is desirable to verify the overall scattering length with a measurement at a dedicated scattering facility such as LANSCE. LANSCE has a neutron Time-Of-Flight (TOF) beam with good resolution in the $10-100 \; keV$ range and so a simple transmission experiment using a liquid argon cylindrical target of diameter $5\;cm$ and length $100-200\; cm$ should be more than sufficient to measure the scattering cross-section in the region of interest.  

%Such an experiment will be proposed to LANSCE in March 2019 to run in early Fall 2019. Costs will be minimal - with only the need to provide a LAr target with a small $~2\; cm$ thin window on both ends, plus perhaps a small halo counter to reject double scatters and a collimated neutron TOF detector (LANL may be able to provide this). While desirable to do, this is not critical.

6 & The effective attenuation length of 57 keV neutrons in \dword{lar} turns out to be significantly smaller than 30 m. & M & A measurement of the transmission at this energy is being proposed at Los Alamos prior to the ProtoDUNE run. The ProtoDUNE run will also provide demonstration. \\ \colhline

7 & The neutron flux from the $DD$ generator could activate the moderator and cryostat insulation. & L & Neutron activation studies of insulation material, and ProtoDUNE testing at neutron flux intensities and durations well above the run plan, as well as simulation studies done in collaboration
with Background Task Force. \\ \colhline

8 & The neutron yield from $DD$ generator is not high enough to provide sufficient neutron captures inside the TPC. & M & Investigation is being done on both commercially available and lab research $DD$ generators; Placing the neutron source closer to the liquid argon TPC may increase the neutron yield by a factor of 6; Operating the $DD$ generator with wider  pulse is under consideration, which would require the photodetector system to provide the neutron capture time t$_{0}$. All of this will be tested in the ProtoDUNE-SP-II run. \\ \colhline

9 & Neutrons produced by the Pulsed Neutron Sources placed at the human access ports at the cryostat corners may not reach the center of the cryostat. & L & An alternative design (Design B in figure~\ref{fig:PNS_source_design}) with neutron source inside the calibration feedthrough ports (centrally located on the cryostat) is being studied. This small format neutron source would be light enough to be moved across different feedthrough ports, providing complementary coverage to the neutron sources at the human access port locations. \\ \colhline
