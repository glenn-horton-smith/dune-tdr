%\fixme{This is a copy of text we sent to Jim Stewart for the integration chapter. This is basic at this time, but we expect to refine it as we develop the ProtoDUNE plans. The general theme should be clear-- test and retest to ensure hardware is sensible before placed in the detector. }

The manufacturer and the institutions in charge of devices will conduct a series of tests to ensure the equipment can perform its intended function as part of \dword{qc}. \dword{qc} also includes post-fabrication tests and tests run after shipping and installation. The overall strategy for the calibration devices is to test that the systems operate correctly and safely in dedicated test stands, then at ProtoDUNE, then tested as appropriate near SURF at SDSMT, and finally underground.

\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Laser System:} The first critical test is  design validation in ProtoDUNE-SP. For assembly and operation of the laser and feedthrough interface, this will be carried out on a mock-up flange, for each of the full hardware sets (periscope, feedthrough, laser, power supply, electronics). All operational parts - UV laser, red alignment laser, trigger photodiode, attenuator, diaphragm, movement motors, encoders - will be tested for functionality prior to transportation underground.
    \item {\bf Pulsed Neutron Source System:} The first test will be safe operation of the system in a member institution radiation-safe facility. Then, the system will be validated at ProtoDUNE. The same procedure %(operation at MSU) , then transportation to SURF and underground, 
    will be carried out for any subsequent devices followed by transportation to SURF and underground. Operation of the system will be tested with shielding assembled to confirm safe operating conditions and sufficient neutron yields with an external dosimeter as well as with the installed neutron monitor. The entire system, once assembled, may be brought down the Ross shaft.
    \item {\bf Radioactive Source Deployment System:}
    A mechanical test of the Double Chooz fish-line deployment system with a \dword{lar} mock-up column will be done in the high bay lab at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. The ultimate test of the system will be done at ProtoDUNE. Safety checks will also be done for the source and appropriate storage on the surface and underground. 
    \item {\bf Power supply and racks:}  Each of the electronics and racks associated to each full system will be tested prior to bringing them underground.
\end{itemize}
