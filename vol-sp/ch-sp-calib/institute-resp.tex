%\label{sec:sp-calib-resp}

%\fixme{SG/JM: Done. KM: take a look. More details in the email I sent. }
%Currently, the calibration consortium has the following member institutions: University of Bern (Bern), Boston University (BU), Colorado State University (CSU), University of California, Davis (UC Davis) University of Hawaii (Hawaii), University of Iowa (Iowa), LIP, Michigan State University (MSU), University of Pittsburgh (Pitt), South Dakota School of Mine Technology (SDSMT), and University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK). 

Calibrations %slow controls and cryogenic instrumentation 
will be a joint effort for \single and \dual. Design validation, testing, calibration, and performance of calibration devices will be evaluated through \dword{protodune} data.

Following the conceptual funding model envisioned for the consortium, various responsibilities have been distributed across institutions within the consortium. At this stage of the project, these should be considered as ``aspirational'' responsibilities until firm funding decisions are made. Table~\ref{tab:calib-inst-resp} shows the current institutional responsibilities for primary calibration subsystems. 
%Only lead institutes are listed in the table for a given effort. 
For physics and simulations studies, and validation efforts with \dword{protodune}, a number of institutes are interested. A 
DUNE DocDB is under preparation to provide a detailed list of tasks and corresponding institutional responsibilities.

%The responsibilities of each group are described in Table~\ref{tab:calibinst}. \fixme{Need to confirm this with groups, esp CSU, Pitt doing general simulation work and understand what further subdivision is useful. We are also seeking new groups.}
