\section{Quality Assurance}
\label{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-qa}

\fixme{lines 43-141 as of 3/19  copied to SP TC (IIC) chapter itf.tex (yes even tho ITF has gone away!)}
The \dword{ce} consortium is developing a \dword{qa} plan consistent
with the principles discussed in the Technical Coordination part of this 
\dword{tdr} (Volume 7 Chapter 9). %Commented out because it breaks the automatic build system %(\refch{tc}{vl:tc-QA}).
The goal of the \dword{qa} plan is to maximize the number of functioning
readout channels in the detector that achieve the performance specifications
for the detector discussed in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-overview-design},
particularly on noise. Minimizing the noise in the detector requires that all
system aspects are considered starting from the design phase, and in this
respect, the experience gained with the \dword{pdsp} prototype is extremely
valuable, informing the design changes in the detector 
components. The lessons learned during the construction of \dword{pdsp},
the commissioning of the detector, and the initial data taking period have
already been discussed in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-design}. Further
operation of \dword{pdsp} in 2019 will continue to inform the final design
of the detector components.

Apart from the number of channels, the most important difference
between \dword{pdsp} and \dword{dune} is the projected lifetime of the detector. This
is relevant because a significant fraction of the detector components provided 
by the \dword{ce} consortium are installed inside the cryostat and cannot 
be accessed or repaired during the operational lifetime of the detector. The 
graded approach to \dword{qa} indicates that particular care must be used for installing the \dword{ce} components inside the cryostat.

A complete \dword{qa} plan starts with ensuring that the designs of all
detector components fulfill the specification criteria, considering
also system aspects, i.e., how the various detector components interact
among themselves and with the detector components provided by other 
consortia. We discuss validating the design in 
Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-qa-initial} and the facilities that we use
to investigate the interactions among different detector components
in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-qa-facilities}. 

The other aspects of the \dword{qa} plan involve documenting the 
assembly and testing processes, storing and analyzing the information
collected during the \dword{qc} process, training and qualifying 
personnel from the consortium, monitoring procurement of 
components from external vendors, and assessing whether the
\dword{qc} procedures are applied uniformly across
the various sites involved in detector construction, integration,
and installation. The \dword{ce} consortium plan involves
having multiple sites using the same \dword{qc} procedures,
many of which will be carried out as part of system design tests in \dword{qa},
with the possibility of a significant turnaround in the personnel
performing these tasks. To avoid problems during most of the
production phase, we plan to emphasize training as well as documentation
of the \dword{qa} plan. Reference parts will be tested at
several sites to ensure consistent results. At
a single site, some parts will be tested repeatedly to ensure
that the response of the apparatus does not change and
that new personnel involved in testing detector components are 
as proficient as more experienced personnel. 

All data from
the \dword{qc} process will be stored in a common database, and
the yields of the production will be centrally monitored and 
compared among different sites. The procedures adopted
for detector construction will evolve from the experience
gained with \dword{pdsp}. A first version of the testing procedures
will be put in place in 2019 and 2020, while the final designs of
the detector components are completed and new prototypes are
tested. The \dword{qc} procedures will be then reviewed
during the engineering design review that precedes pre-production. Lessons learned during pre-production
will be analyzed, and a final and improved \dword{qc} process will be 
developed before the production readiness review that triggers
the beginning of production. During production, the results
of the \dword{qc} process will be reviewed at regular intervals
in production progress reviews. In case of problems, production
will be stopped, and the issues will be analyzed 
and procedures will be changed if necessary.

\subsection{Initial Design Validation}
\label{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-qa-initial}

As described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-design}, four \dwords{asic} 
are being developed for the \dword{dune} \dword{fd} single-phase \dword{tpc} readout 
(\dword{larasic}, \dword{coldadc}, \dword{coldata}, and \dword{cryo}). 
When a new prototype \dword{asic} is produced, the groups responsible for the \dword{asic} design will perform the first tests of 
\dword{asic} functionality and performance. These tests may use either 
packaged parts or dice mounted directly on a printed circuit board 
and wire bonded to the board.  The goal of these tests is to determine 
the extent to which the \dword{asic} functions as intended, both at room 
temperature and at \lntwo temperature.  For all chips, these tests 
include exercising digital control logic and all modes of operation. Tests 
of \dword{fe} \dwords{asic} include measurements of noise as a function 
of input capacitance, baseline recovery from large pulses, cross-talk, linearity, 
and dynamic range. Tests of \dwords{adc} include measurements of the effective noise and 
of differential as well as integral non-linearity. Tests of \dword{coldata} and \dword{cryo} 
include verification of both the control and high speed data output links with 
cables at least as long at the longest cables needed in the \dword{dune} \dword{fd} 
(currently estimated to be \SI{22}{m}). After the initial functionality
tests by the groups that designed the \dwords{asic}, further
tests will be performed by other independent groups; then the \dwords{asic}
will be mounted on \dwords{femb} so noise measurements can be repeated
with real \dword{apa}s attached to the readout.

Tests of \dwords{asic} and\dwords{femb} in a cryogenic environment
are performed in \lntwo instead of \dword{lar} for cost reasons, ignoring
the small temperature difference. These tests can be performed immersing
the detector components in a dewar containing \lntwo for the duration
of the tests. Condensation of water from air can interfere with
the tests or damage the detector components or the test equipment,
particularly during their extraction from the \lntwo. A test dewar
design developed by Michigan State University, referred to as the
Cryogenic Test System (\dword{cts}), has been developed to avoid
this problem and to automate the immersion and the retrieval of 
the components being tested. Several \dword{cts} units
were deployed at \dword{bnl} for \dword{pdsp} production, \dword{femb} \dword{qc}, and SBND \dword{asic} \dword{qc}.
Several others have already been deployed to institutions involved in
developing \dwords{asic} to test the first prototypes of \dwords{asic}
and \dwords{femb}. Two \dword{cts} units in operation at \dword{bnl} are 
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CTS}.

\subsection{Integrated Test Facilities}
\label{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-qa-facilities}

The investigation of the system issues that can arise from the interaction 
of different detector components requires that a full system test of a slice
of the entire detector is performed. These tests are performed with \dwords{femb}
attached to \dword{apa}s enclosed in a structure that provides the same
grounding environment planned for the final \dword{dune} detector. The
power, control, and readout connections for the readout of the detector
will be provided using cryostat penetrations similar to the \dword{dune}
design. Prototypes of the final \dword{daq} will be used for readout and
control of the detector, and if possible the \dword{pds} and \dword{cpa}
detector components. We have identified three such system test stands
that we can use for system tests: the \dword{protodune} facility at CERN, the
\dword{iceberg} facility at \dword{fnal}, and the \num{40}\,\% \dword{apa} at \dword{bnl}.
We discuss these three setups in the following.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{ProtoDUNE-SP}
\label{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-qa-facilities-pdune}

\dword{pdsp} is designed as a full slice of the \dword{spmod} as close as 
possible to the final \dword{dune}\dword{sp} components. It contains six full-size 
\dword{dune} \dword{apa}s instrumented with \num{20} \dwords{femb} each for a 
total readout channel count of \num{15360} digitized sense wires. Critically, 
the wires on each \dword{apa} are read out via a full \dword{ce} readout 
system, including a \dword{ce} flange and \dword{wiec} with five \dwords{wib} 
and one \dword{ptc}. Each combined \dword{apa} and \dword{ce} readout follows 
the grounding guidelines described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-design-grounding} 
to operate as a fully-isolated readout unit.

\dword{pdsp} took beam data in the CERN Neutrino Platform in 2018 and will continue
to take cosmic data throughout 2019. As described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-overview-pdune},
the live channel count (99.7\%) and average noise levels on the collection and induction wires 
(ENC~$<$~\SI{600}{e$^-$} and \SI{800}{e$^-$}, respectively) satisfy the \dword{dune}\dword{sp} requirements described 
in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-overview-requirements}. Several lessons learned from the production 
and testing of the \dword{ce} and the \dword{pdsp} beam data run will be incorporated into the 
next iteration of the system design for the \dword{spmod}, as discussed in 
Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-overview-lessons}.

Five of the six \dword{apa}s were tested in the \dword{pdsp} cold box
before they were installed in the cryostat. These tests were critical
in identifying issues with \dword{ce} components after installation
on the \dword{apa}. Therefore, a very similar set of cold box tests are planned at \dword{surf} 
with the fully-instrumented \dword{dune} \dword{apa}s. A seventh \dword{apa} will be delivered
to CERN in March 2019 and equipped at first with \dword{pdsp} \dwords{femb}. This
\dword{apa} will be characterized in the cold box like the \dword{apa}s installed
in \dword{pdsp}, establishing a reference point for further tests that will be
performed after replacing half of the \dwords{femb} with new prototypes equipped with the
new \dwords{asic} being developed for \dword{dune}. 

The \dword{dune} \dword{apa}s and the readout electronics will differ from the ones used 
in \dword{pdsp}. For this reason, we are planning to re-open the \dword{pdsp} cryostat 
and replace three of the six \dword{apa}s with final \dword{dune} prototypes that also include 
the final versions of the \dwords{asic} and \dwords{femb}. A second period of data-taking 
with this new configuration of \dword{pdsp} is planned for 2021-2022. This will also 
allow another opportunity to check for interference between the readout of the \dword{apa} 
wires and either the \dword{pds} or other cryogenic instrumentation.

ASICs}

\subsubsection{Small Test TPC (ICEBERG)}
\label{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-qa-facilities-testtpc}

While the cold box test at CERN and \dword{pdsp} operations provide important validation of the \dword{ce} for DUNE, a new cryostat (ICEBERG) has been built to test multiple \dword{ce} prototypes in a \dword{lartpc} environment. % that will be used for such system tests. The ICEBERG cryostat 
%The main drawbacks of the tests in the cold box at CERN are that the \dword{apa}
%operates in gas and has no electric field to provide signals from tracks passing in the
%detector. Additionally, \dword{pdsp} is too large to accommodate changing out the \dword{ce}
%for testing multiple \dword{ce} prototypes without incurring significant expense. To overcome
%these issues, \dword{fermilab} has built a new cryostat (\dword{iceberg}) 
%that 
ICEBERG will be used for 
\dword{lar} detector R\&D and for system tests of the \dword{ce} prototypes. 
The \dword{iceberg} cryostat, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ICEBERG-cryotee} is installed
at the Proton Assembly Building at \dword{fermilab}. It has an inner diameter of \SI{152}{cm}
and can hold about 35,000 liters of \dword{lar}, sufficient to house a
\dword{tpc} with dimensions \SI{115}{cm}~$\times$~\SI{100}{cm}~$\times$~\SI{60}{cm}. For
\dword{dune} purposes, this cryostat will house a 1,280-channel \dword{tpc}, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:ICEBERG-tpcdaq}, with an \dword{apa} and two \dwords{fc}, each 
enclosing a sensitive volume with a maximum drift distance of \SI{30}{cm}. The \dword{apa} 
has been built using the same wire boards and anchoring elements of \dword{pdsp} 
described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-apa-boards}. It has dimensions of 
1/10$^{\mathrm{th}}$ of a \dword{dune} \dword{apa}. The \dword{apa} mechanics are designed to
accommodate two half-length \dword{pdsp} bars with dimensions and connectors that already 
include the design modifications planned for \dword{dune}.

  \includegraphics[angle=270,width=0.43\linewidth]{sp-tpcelec-ICEBERG-DAQ.jpg}
\end{dunefigure}

Power, readout, and controls use equipment identical to those used for \dword{pdsp}. The
interface between the \dwords{femb} and the \dword{apa} wires uses the same \dword{cr} boards
used for \dword{pdsp} and described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-apa-boards}. The \dword{tpc} is
readout via a \dword{daq} system (also shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ICEBERG-tpcdaq})
identical to that of \dword{pdsp}. The power and signal cables for the detector 
are routed through a Tee installed on the center port of a movable flange on the 
top of the cryostat that is also used to support the \dword{tpc}. The movable 
flange contains fourteen additional ports that are available for different utilities, 
including \dword{hv} feedthrough, purity monitor, cryogenic controls, and visual inspection. 
A condenser and \dword{lar} fill and vacuum ports are on the side of the cryostat, 
providing easy access to the detector.

The \dword{fc} for the \dword{tpc} is constructed using printed circuit boards and 
designed to provide 25 cm of drift space on both sides of the \dword{apa}. The cathode 
plane is made of a printed circuit board coated with copper and will be powered with 
\SI{-15}{kV} DC power. A \SI{1}{G$\Omega$} resistance between the strips of the \dword{fc}
creates a gradient field changing from \SI{-15}{kV} at the cathode to \SI{-1}{kV} near the 
\dword{apa}. The sides of the \dwords{fc} are terminated on the \dword{apa}
ground with \SI{156}{M$\Omega$} resistors. 

The \dword{iceberg} power system that provides power to the detector, electronics, 
\dword{daq}, and cryogenics controls was designed with extreme care to 
isolate the detector and building grounds, following the same principles adopted
for \dword{pdsp} and including a new \SI{480}{V} transformer. The impedance between the detector
and building grounds is continuously monitored. The distribution panel, which is 
at detector ground, provides 208 and \SI{120}{V} power for the \dword{ce} rack, 
providing both the low voltage power to the \dword{ce} components and the bias 
voltage to the \dword{apa} wire planes, through the \dword{wiec} and \dword{shv}
connectors located on the cryostat penetration. A single WIENER MPOD provides 
\SI{-665}{V}, \SI{-370}{V}, \SI{0}{V}, and \SI{820}{V} to the grid, U, V, and 
Y planes of the \dword{apa}, respectively. It is also used to provide the 
\SI{-16.6}{kV} to the cathode plane. A WIENER PL506 provides the low voltage
power to the \dword{ptc}, the fans and the heaters located in the 
Tee at the top of the cryostat. 

The \dword{daq} for \dword{iceberg} is a copy of the system used for the readout
of five of the \dword{pdsp} \dword{apa}s at CERN. The core of the \dword{daq} system 
consists of two Linux PCs that communicate over 10 Gbps optical fiber
to processing units called \dwords{rce}, which are \dwords{fpga} that are
housed on industry-standard \dword{atca} shelves on \dword{cob} motherboards.
The \dwords{rce} can perform data compression and zero-suppression. They also buffer
the data while waiting for a trigger and then send it to the Linux PCs where the data can
be analyzed using the \dword{artdaq} framework. A pair of scintillators at the top and
bottom of the cryostat generates a cosmic trigger for the \dword{daq}.
The system is modular and could be upgraded to follow the overall \dword{dune} \dword{daq} 
development. 

The baseline performance of the \dword{iceberg} \dword{tpc}
will be established using \dword{pdsp} \dwords{femb}. Later, new prototypes, equipped
with the new \dwords{asic} under development, will be tested. The main advantage
of the tests to be performed at \dword{iceberg} is that the performance of the
\dword{ce} prototypes will be measured with actual tracks from cosmic rays 
reconstructed within the \dword{tpc}. In addition, system studies with new 
prototypes of the \dword{pds} will be performed because the \dword{apa} is
mechanically compatible with the new design of the \dword{pds}, which is not
the case for the seventh \dword{pdsp} \dword{apa}.  In particular, the \dword{pds} mounting
scheme can be tested at \dword{iceberg}, despite the units being half-sized compared to the
size of the photodetectors in the \dword{dune} \dword{fd} \dword{apa}s.

ASICs}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{40\% APA at \dword{bnl}}
\label{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-qa-facilities-fortypercent}

One additional facility where the \dword{femb} prototypes can be connected to
an \dword{apa} inside a shielded environment is the \num{40}\,\% \dword{apa} 
test stand at \dword{bnl}. The \num{40}\,\% \dword{apa} at \dword{bnl} is a \SI{2.8}{m}~$\times$~\SI{1.0}{m} 
three-plane \dword{apa} with two layers of \num{576} wrapped ($U$ and $V$) wires 
and one layer of \num{448} straight ($X$) wires. It is read out by up to eight 
\dwords{femb} with the full \SI{7}{m} \dword{pdsp} length data and \dword{lv} power 
cables, four on the top and four on the bottom. The readout uses the full \dword{ce} 
system, with \dword{ce} flange and \dword{wiec}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tpcelec_40apa}. 
Detailed integration tests of the \dword{pdsp} \dword{ce} readout performance while 
following the \dword{dune} grounding and shielding guidelines were done at the \num{40}\,\% 
\dword{apa}. This system was also used for initial studies of the \dword{cots} \dword{adc}
option described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-design-femb-alt-cots} and will
be used again for new \dword{femb} prototypes.

\begin{dunefigure}
[One side of the \num{40}\,\% \dword{apa} with four \dwords{femb} and the full \dword{ce} \fdth and flange.]

\hspace{3mm}
\includegraphics[width=0.2\linewidth]{sp-tpcelec-40-apa-ft.png}
\end{dunefigure}

Each of the three set ups that can be used for system tests has advantages
and disadvantages. Only the \dword{iceberg} \dword{tpc} can be used to 
perform measurements with tracks, but the \dword{apa} is 
much smaller than the \dword{dune} \dword{fd} \dword{apa} (which is also an advantage because it
allows us to determine the ultimate performance of the electronics because
the detector capacitance is reduced). The \dword{iceberg} \dword{tpc}
is for the moment the only set-up compatible with the new \dword{pds}
design. Tests performed in the cold box at CERN and with the \num{40}\,\% \dword{apa} 
at \dword{bnl} are limited to noise measurements. These tests are not
performed at the \dword{lar} temperature in the CERN set up. The advantage of
both set ups, and in particular, of tests performed using the \dword{pdsp}
\dword{apa}, is that the detector size is the one used in \dword{dune} while the \dword{iceberg} detector is
much smaller. While developing
new \dwords{asic} and \dwords{femb}, we plan to continue using all
three set ups for testing.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Reliability Studies}
\label{sec:fdsp-tpcelec-qa-reliability}

The \dword{tpc} cold electronics system of the \dword{dune} \dword{sp} \dword{fd} must meet 
stringent requirements like low ($<<$ 1\%) failure rate of components installed 
on the detector inside the cryostat during the \dunelifetime of 
detector operation. Reliability must be incorporated in the 
design of all components, and a dedicated analysis of all the possible failure mechanisms is required 
before finalizing the design of all \dwords{asic}, printed circuit boards, cables, 
connectors, and their supports, all of which are housed inside the \dword{dune} \dword{fd} 
cryostat. 

A few high energy physics detectors have operated without intervention for a 
prolonged period, with few readout channel losses, in extreme 
conditions similar to those in the \dword{dune} cryostats:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The NA48/NA62 liquid Krypton (LKr) calorimeter has 13,212 channels 
	of JFET pre-amplifiers installed on its detector. It has been kept at LKr temperature 
	since 1998. The failure rate is $<$ 0.2\% for 20 years of operation so far.
	\item The ATLAS \dword{lar} accordion Electromagnetic Barrel calorimeter has 
	approximately 110,000 readout signal channels, with up to seven connections and different 
	circuit boards populated with resistors and diodes inside the cryostat. This
        calorimeter has been cold since 2004, for 14 years of operation. So far, the
        failure rate of readout channels is approximately 0.02\%.
        \item The ATLAS \dword{lar} Hadronic Endcap Calorimeter has approximately 35,000 GaAs
        preamplifers summed into 5,600 readout channels that are mounted on cold preamplifier
        and summing boards. The ATLAS \dword{lar} Hadronic Endcap 
        Calorimeter cold electronics have been in cold since 2004, with approximately 
        0.37\% failure rate during 14 years of operation. 
\end{itemize}
In addition, FERMI/GLAST is an example of a joint project between \dword{nasa} and HEP groups 
with a minimum mission requirement of five years and is on its way to achieving a 
stretch goal of ten years of operations in space. Although the requirements are somewhat 
different, examining and understanding the various strategies for a space 
flight project can inform the \dword{dune} project. 

A preliminary list of reliability topics to be studied for the \dword{tpc} electronics operated 
in \dword{lar} environment are
\begin{itemize}
	\item The custom \dwords{asic} proposed for use in \dword{dune} (\dword{larasic}, 
	\dword{coldadc}, \dword{coldata}, and \dword{cryo}) incorporate design rules 
	intended to minimize the hot-carrier effect\cite{Li:CELAr,Hoff:2015hax}, 
	which is recognized as the main failure mechanism for integrated circuits 
	operating at \dword{lar} temperature.
        \item For \dword{cots} components, accelerated lifetime testing, a methodology 
	developed by \dword{nasa}~\cite{nasa_nepp} will be used to verify the expected
        lifetime of operation at cryogenic temperatures. A \dword{cots} \dword{adc} has undergone
        this procedure and has been qualified as a solution for the SBND experiment~\cite{Chen:2018zic}.
	\item Printed circuit board assemblies are designed and fabricated to survive 
	repeated immersions in \lntwo.
        \item A study will be undertaken to give guidance on how much components (capacitors,
        resistors, etc.) should be de-rated for power dissipation, operating voltage, etc.~in
        order to achieve the desired reliability.
        \item Similarly, connectors and cables, usually major sources of detector channel failures,
        will require a separate study to identify optimal choices.
        \item In addition to the \dword{qa} studies noted above, it is likely that very detailed
        and formal \dword{qc} checks of the production pieces will be required in order to ensure
        a reliable detector.
\end{itemize}
The \dword{ce} consortium has formed a working group tasked with studying the reliability  
of these components and is preparing recommendations for the choice of \dwords{asic}, 
the design of printed circuit boards, and testing. This working group will review the 
segmentation of the cold electronics to understand which failures will most affect data taking; revisit recommendations for the \dword{asic} design, 
beyond those aimed at minimizing the hot-carrier effect; revisit the industry and 
\dword{nasa} standards for the design and fabrication of printed circuit boards, connectors, 
and cables; and recommend \dword{qc} procedures to be adopted during 
fabrication of the cold electronics components. The working group will also review
system aspects, to understand where it is desirable, necessary, and feasible to implement 
redundancy in the system to minimize data losses due to single component failures.
