%\subsection{High-level Milestones and Schedule}
%\label{sec:fdsp-apa-org-cs}

The high-level milestones between 2018 and 2024, both before and after the \dword{tdr}, are given in Table~\ref{tab:milestones}. The final design of the \dwords{apa} proposed in the \dword{tdr} will be informed by \dword{pdsp} \dword{apa} production and performance, which will be reviewed in early 2019. Additional design considerations that cannot be directly tested through \dword{pdsp}, like the two-\dword{apa} assembly and related cabling issues, will require a full test with cabling of a two-\dword{apa} assembly, also set for early 2019. The production schedule, the required number of assembly lines, and the location of the production factories will depend on improvements in the wire winding procedures, which will be formally reviewed in January 2019. The post-\dword{tdr} milestones are driven by high-level international project milestones and are based on a schedule that includes one year of factory preparation and about two years of \dword{apa} construction.
