\fixme{Table~\ref{tab:Xsched} is a standard table template for the TDR schedules.  It contains overall FD dates from Eric James as of March 2019 (orange) that are held in macros in the common/defs.tex file so that the TDR team can change them if needed. Please do not edit these lines! Please add your milestone dates to fit in with the overall FD schedule. Please set captions and label appropriately. Anne}

%\subsection{High-level Milestones and Schedule}
%\label{sec:fdsp-apa-org-cs}

The high-level milestones between 2018 and 202x, both before and after the \dword{tdr}, are given in Table~\ref{tab:milestones}. The final design of the \dwords{apa} proposed in the \dword{tdr} will be informed by \dword{pdsp} \dword{apa} production and performance, which will be reviewed in early 2019. Additional design considerations that cannot be directly tested through \dword{pdsp}, like the two-\dword{apa} assembly and related cabling issues, will require a full test with cabling of a two-\dword{apa} assembly, also set for early 2019. The production schedule, the required number of assembly lines, and the location of the production factories will depend on improvements in the wire winding procedures, which will be formally reviewed in early 2019. The post-\dword{tdr} milestones are driven by high-level international project milestones and are based on a schedule that includes one year of factory preparation and about two years and a half of \dword{apa} construction.
