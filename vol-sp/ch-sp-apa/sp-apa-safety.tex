\section{Safety Considerations}
\label{sec:fdsp-apa-safety}

Building on the experience of \dword{pdsp}, a full safety analysis will be performed and a set of safe work procedures developed for all stages of the fabrication process before starting DUNE \dword{apa} production.  In the final design of the winding machine, central to the production process, safety must be incorporated right from the design stage and at all stages in the life of the machine: design, manufacture, installation, adjustment, operation, and maintenance.  Handling of the large, but delicate frames is a major challenge, and safe procedures will be developed for all phases of construction, including frame assembly, wiring, transport, and integration and installation in the cryostat.         

At the factory sites, safety is ultimately the responsibility of the host institutions, and all local rules and regulations must be followed.  However, common job hazard analyses can be performed and documents prepared for many shared aspects of the tooling and activities.  In addition, safety will be an important element of production readiness reviews conducted for the project overall and for the factory sites individually.
