%\fixme{PSL: input needed. are there old tests of APA components we want to present here?  things like the long-term wire tension studies, etc.}  

The most important and complete information for assuring the quality of the \dword{apa} design, components, materials, and construction methods comes from the construction and operation of \dword{pdsp}.  We have already learned much about design, component testing, and fabrication procedures that is informing the detailed design and plans for the DUNE \dword{apa} construction project. ProtoDUNE included six full-scale DUNE \dwords{apa} instrumenting two drift regions around a central cathode.  Four of the ProtoDUNE \dword{apa}s were constructed in the USA at %the University of Wisconsin 
PSL, and two were made at Daresbury Laboratory in the UK. All were shipped to CERN, integrated with photon detectors and cold electronics and testing in a cold box prior to installation into the \dword{pdsp} cryostat.  Figure~\ref{fig:sp-apa-pd-photo} shows a photo of one of the drift regions in the fully constructed ProtoDUNE detector.

\subsection{Results from \dword{pdsp} Construction}
\label{sec:fdsp-apa-qa-protodune-const}

A thorough set of QC tests were performed and documented throughout the fabrication of the \dword{pdsp} \dword{apa}s.  The positive outcomes give great confidence in the quality of the overall \dword{apa} design  and construction techniques.  Here we summarize some of the testing that was done for \dword{pdsp} and the results.   

%All printed circuit boards (PCBs) were electrically tested and cleaned according to IPC standard. Dimensional checks were performed and all solder pads checked for damage. Any boards that required corrective machining were washed thoroughly, and PCBs were always handled with gloves to prevent contamination.

After each wire layer was applied to an \dword{apa}, continuity between the head and foot boards was checked.  This test is most useful for the U and V layers, where metal traces on the side boards can be damaged during construction. All boards were visually inspected as construction proceeded.

Also after each wire layer was finished, channels were checked for isolation.  In the beginning wire-to-wire isolation was measured. Those measurements took a lot of time and no problems ever arose.  In the end, each wire was individually hi-pot tested at 1 KV. No failures were ever seen. However, leakage currents were seen to be highly dependent on relative humidity.  The surface of the epoxy has some affinity for moisture in the air and provides a measurable leakage path when relative humidity exceeds about 60 percent.

Wire tension was measured for all wires at production. Wire tension measurements were performed again for a subset of wires on each \dword{apa} after arriving to CERN.  Based on the traveler documents provided by the production sites, wires having outlier tension values were selected from each APA for re-measurement at CERN. In addition, a set of randomly selected wires from each plane were measured. In total, for six APAs, $\sim$1500 wires had their tension re-measured at CERN. Measurements took place in the clean room with \dword{apa}s hanging vertically, the first time the tensions were sampled in this orientation. Tension measurements were performed by using the laser-photodiode based method, the same as at the production sites. Figure~\ref{fig:sp-apa-pd-tension} shows the comparison of tension values measured at CERN vs. at production site for the selected subset of wires from each wire plane.

To test if a cold cycle had any effect on the wire tension, samples of wires had their tension measured again after the cold-box tests at CERN. This is the only tension data we have after a cold-cycle for \dword{pd} \dword{apa}s. The results are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:sp-apa-pd-tension-cold}, which shows no significant change in the resonant frequency of the wires, indicating cold cycle does not have any significant effect on wire tension.

\subsection{Results from \dword{pdsp} Operation}
\label{sec:fdsp-apa-qa-protodune-ops}

%\fixme{Roxanne: noise-tension correlation studies.  I know more time is needed to complete, but do we want to briefly describe the plan here?}

Analysis of \dword{pdsp} data is ongoing and will continue into 2019.  Several useful analyses are underway or planned including studying the impact of the electron diverters on reconstruction and colorimetry and quantifying any correlations between wire tension and channel performance (especially noise levels). 

Already known from final testing in the cold box at CERN and initial operations is the very low number of dead channels due to the \dword{apa}s themselves.  This is summarized in Tables~\ref{tab:deadchan1} and \ref{tab:deadchan2}.  The dead channel count, only 0.27\% overall, is uniform across planes and across all six \dword{apa}s made at the two different production sites.

\subsection{Final Design Prototyping and Test Assemblages}
\label{sec:fdsp-apa-qa-prototyping}

To confirm modifications made to the \dword{apa} design and production process since \dword{pd} and work through the multi-\dword{apa} assembly procedures, several prototypes are planned for 2019-2020.\\
\\
A 7th ProtoDUNE-like \dword{apa} is in its final assembly stage at Daresbury Laboratory in the UK, by utilizing an upgraded winding machine with a new interface arm design. The \dword{apa} will be shipped to CERN for a test of the \dword{ce}. In addition, work is in progress to implement a new winding head, with automatic tension feedback and control on the wires. Similar upgrades will be implemented, by middle of 2019, on the winding machine at %the University of Wisconsin  
PSL.\\
\\
A top and a bottom version bare \dword{apa} frame will be built and shipped to Ash River by early Spring 2019 for a full test of the \dword{apa}-doublet assembly procedure and the routing of the \dword{ce} cables through the \dword{apa} side beams, following preliminary cable routing tests carried out at %the University of Wisconsin 
PSL. The Ash River setup will also be used to test the routing of the PDS prototype cables inside the \dword{apa} frames and the cable connection between the lower and upper \dword{apa}.\\
\\
In addition, three fully winded \dword{apa}s, two from the US and one from the UK, with pre-installed \dword{pds} cables, will be built by middle 2020 for a final test before mass production begins. This will allow a test of all \dword{apa} components, including the larger size frames and geometry boards, and a final tuning of the winding machines. The three \dword{apa}s will be shipped to CERN, integrated with \dword{ce} boxes and \dword{pds} detectors, and tested in the cold box. The three \dword{apa}s can be later installed in \dword{pdsp}, by replacing the detectors of one of the drift volumes, for a final test with beam.
