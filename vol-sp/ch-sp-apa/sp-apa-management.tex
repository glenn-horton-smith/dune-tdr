\section{Organization and Management}
\label{sec:fdsp-apa-org}

Coordination of the groups participating in the DUNE \dword{apa} consortium is critical to successfully executing the large-scale multi-year construction project that is needed to produce high-quality \dword{apa}s for the the DUNE far detectors.

\subsection{APA Consortium Organization}
\label{sec:fdsp-apa-org-consortium}

The \dword{apa} consortium comprises \num{22} institutions, of which \num{14} are in the USA, seven in the UK, and one in the Czech Republic. The consortium is organized along the main deliverables, which are the final design of the \dword{apa} and the \dword{apa} production and installation procedures. The two main centers of \dword{apa} construction are in the USA and the UK, so usually, the two leaders of each working group represent the main stakeholders (Figure~\ref{fig:apa-consortium-structure}) to ensure that common procedures and tooling are developed.

\subsection{Planning Assumptions}
\label{sec:fdsp-apa-org-assmp}

The planning assumes nine \dword{apa} assembly lines at different locations in the UK and the USA. 
We assume set up time for the factories will take about one year.
It will take approximately \num{40} shifts (8 hours) of clock time  to construct a single \dword{apa}. Assuming an 8 hours shift/day, we can construct the \num{150} \dwords{apa} required for one \dword{spmod} %\SI{10}{kton} module 
within about two and a half years.

\subsection{WBS and Responsibilities}
\label{sec:fdsp-apa-org-wbs}

Here, we only discuss the top-level WBS elements: (1)~design, engineering and prototypes, (2)~production setup, (3)~production, (4)~integration, and (5)~installation.

The university groups and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) are responsible for validating  the design, while engineering and the production set up will be developed at PSL %at the University of Wisconsin-Madison 
(USA) and Daresbury Laboratory (UK), where the \dwords{apa} for \dword{pdsp} have been built. 
%with contributions from university groups. \fixme{Nora: I think what you mean here is that the university groups will contribute to developing the engineering and production set up. To make that clear, you likely will need another sentence instead of "with contributions from university groups". So "The university groups will contribute to developing..."} 
In addition to PSL and Daresbury Laboratory, the University of Chicago and Yale University have been identified as sites for the production, and detailed planning of the factory layouts and activities at each site is currently ongoing. A successful production effort will require significant contributions from all university groups throughout the production process.
%The production sites will require significant help from university groups during the production process. 

In total, we expect to produce half of the \dwords{apa} in the USA and half in the UK. The steel for the frames most likely will be bought from a single vendor but will be assembled in the USA and the UK separately. We are still exploring the option to assemble the frames in house or in collaboration with industrial partners. 

Other significant components include on-\dword{apa} electronics boards. Design modifications for \dword{pdsp} are the responsibility of PSL, University of Wisconsin-Madison. The boards will be produced by industry partners, but the testing will be distributed among consortium institutions. The shipping of the \dwords{apa} is the responsibility of the production factories in the USA and the UK, while the design of the \dword{apa} transport frame is responsibility of the UK groups. The integration and installation are a joint responsibility of the consortium, with UK taking the a leading role for integration and US for installation. Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) is cooperating with the technical coordination group for the design of the \dword{apa} support system within the cryostat.
