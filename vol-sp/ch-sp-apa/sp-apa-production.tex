\section{Production Plan}
\label{sec:fdsp-apa-prod}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \dword{apa} consortium oversees design, construction, and testing of the DUNE \dword{spmod} \dwords{apa}. % within the collaboration.  
The \dword{apa} consortium takes a \textit{factory style} approach to the construction with several factories being planned in the USA and UK. This approach allows the consortium to produce \dwords{apa} at the rate required to meet overall construction milestones and, at the same time, reduce risk to the project if any location has problems that slow the production pace.

The starting point for the \dword{apa} plan to produce the \dwords{spmod} is the experience and lessons learned from \dword{pdsp} construction. For \dword{pdsp}, \dwords{apa} have been constructed both at the Physical Sciences Laboratory (PSL) at the University of Wisconsin in the USA and at Daresbury Laboratory in the UK.  The goal now is to construct \dword{apa} for DUNE at USA and UK collaborating institutions, and assuming construction begins in 2021, at least six production lines are required to build \num{150} \dwords{apa} within \num{2.5} years for the first %DUNE 
\SI{10}{kt} \dword{spmod}.   

Based on the \dword{pdsp} experience, we estimate that each \dword{apa} requires approximately \num{50} shifts (eight-hour intervals) of effort to construct, using a mix of engineering, technical, and scientific personnel. This estimate involves only the wiring stages of production and assumes that completed frames and all other hardware necessary for construction are ready to go at the factories. Currently an \dword{apa} can be completed in \num{64} shifts. Improvements to the process and tooling are planned that will bring this down to the required \num{50} shifts. The production model assumes that factories run two shifts per day and that two weeks per year are devoted to maintaining equipment. 

Each production line is centered around a wire winding robot, or \textit{winder}, that enables continuous wrapping of wire on a \SI{6}{m} long frame. The winder can also be used to make wire tension measurements by replacing the winding head with a laser photodiode system that can determine an individual wire's natural frequency and hence its tension. A production line also requires two process carts. These carts support the \dword{apa} and are used during various steps during construction like continuity testing and board epoxy installation, among other processes. A production line, therefore, requires a means of lifting the \dword{apa} in and out of the winder. A gantry-style crane was used for \dword{pdsp} construction.

Having several \dword{apa} production sites in two different countries presents quality assurance and quality control (\dshort{qa}/\dshort{qc}) challenges. Key among the requirements of production is that every \dword{apa} be the same, regardless of where it was constructed. To achieve this goal, we are building on \dword{pdsp} experience where six identical \dwords{apa} were built, four in the USA and two in the UK. The same tooling, fabrication drawings, assembly, and test procedures were used at each location, and identical acceptance criteria were established at both sites.  This uniform approach to construction for DUNE is necessary, and the \dword{apa} consortium is developing the necessary management structure to ensure that each factory and production line follows the agreed upon approach to achieve \dword{apa} performance requirements.

\subsection{Assembly Procedures and Tooling}
\label{sec:fdsp-apa-prod-tooling}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{comment}
A subset of procedures describing how to perform the step-by-step assembly of an \dword{apa} was originally created prior to the finalization of the \dword{pdsp} \dword{apa} series of drawings, and assigned drawing numbers. During subsequent assemblies, these instructions have evolved due to the addition of better tooling, fixtures, jigs and more complete drawing documents.  The process steps contained in each procedure have also been changed to create a better match with the B.O.M. (Bill Of Materials) contained on each finalized drawing level.  Table~\ref{tab:assembly-docs} lists what documents are available related to each assembly level.  Currently these documents are being revised to reflect the latest evolution of these procedures that were used to assemble US-\dword{apa}-4 for \dword{pdsp}.

The central piece of equipment used in \dword{apa} production is the custom-designed wire winder machine, shown in use in Figure~\ref{fig:winder-photos}.  An important centerpiece of the winder machine is the wiring head.  The head releases wire as motors move it up and down and across the frame, controlling the tension in the wire as it is laid. Currently, the head then positions the wire at solder connection points for soldering by hand. The fully automated motion of the winder head is controlled by software, which is written in the widely used numerical control G programming language.  The winder also includes a built-in vision system to assist operators during winding, which is currently used at winding start-up to find a locator pin on the wire boards.  In the current scheme used for \dword{pdsp}, during the winding process, an \dword{apa} moves on and off the winder machine several times for wiring, soldering, testing, etc.  

\fixme{From Nora: I'm really not fond of using etc. in formal presentations. If the list is a partial list, that can be clarified by a statement such as "...on and off the winder machine several times for such things as wiring, soldering, and testing."}

Two large process carts, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:apa-process-cart}, are used to move \dwords{apa} around the assembly facility. 
%and also move them to a shipping/packing location area for loading into specialized crate containers. 
One process cart with regular casters remains in the assembly area; it is kept at a particular height that coordinates with other construction tooling equipment like jack stands and platform ladders. A second process cart has been fitted with specialized 360$^\circ$ rotating casters that allow the process cart, loaded with a fully assembled \dword{apa}, to maneuver corners while moving it from the assembly area to the packing/shipping location.

Before wiring can begin, grounding mesh must be installed on the bare frame. In the \dword{pdsp} design, a large jig holds the mesh in place for gluing. Once the jig is sufficiently leveled to the frame, a mesh sheet is laid into place and hold down bars are iteratively moved and repositioned until the mesh is flat and tight.  The outside edge of the mesh panel is then epoxied, and the jig and hold down bars remain in place for a 12 hour epoxy cure cycle.  This process is then repeated for the next three shifts until all four panels of mesh have been attached to the bare \dword{apa} frame.  As described below, we are considering changes to this lengthy procedure for DUNE \dwords{apa}.  

Another custom construction jig is needed to install the wire combs that hold the wires at intermediate points above the four cross beams of the \dword{apa}.  Currently, two jigs can be loaded and installed at a time, and each installation requires a six-hour epoxy cure cycle. %the two jigs are removed from the initial locations and placed in another two locations, on the same side of the \dword{apa}.  Thus four comb bases are installed within one operation shift and the \dword{apa} is left in this horizontal position to cure overnight.  The next day, the \dword{apa} is flipped to the reverse side and the process is repeated for the other side. Figure~\ref{fig:apa-process-cart} shows the comb installation jig in use.

\subsubsection{Planned Improvements to Production Process}

Based on our \dword{pdsp} experience, we have identified several potential changes to tooling and processing that should make the \dwords{apa} construction more efficient and reliable. 

\begin{itemize}

\item Wiring head design: Efforts to improve winder head performance are already underway. We envision improved tension control, continuous tension feedback, improved clutch, and improvement to the compensator mechanism, all leading to better, more consistent, and more reliable winder performance.  The current winding head uses a magnetic clutch mechanism that is manually adjusted to increase or decrease the tension of the wire as it is wound around the \dword{apa}. The clutch regularly needs adjustment because the diameter of the wire on the spool declines during the winding process. In addition, if the mechanism is run from a cold start, the tension changes after $\sim$10 minutes of running. Experience winding the \dword{pdsp} \dwords{apa} has shown that maintaining the target tension within tolerances (5$\pm$\SI{1}{N} for \dword{pdsp}) is difficult.

A solution to this issue is to design a winder head with active tension control by replacing the magnetic clutch with a servo motor and introducing a potentiometer on a dancer arm for the feedback loop (see Figure~\ref{fig:winding-head}). This only works if no signal losses occur when transferring the winding head to the compensator latching mechanism and back. The system can be driven in torque mode and should compensate for any wire spool changes. It must be able to operate from a cold start. This development is well underway, and the changes are being tested.

\begin{dunefigure}[Exploded view of the winding machine head]{fig:winding-head}
{Exploded view of winder head with active tension control.}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{sp-apa-winder-head-with-active-tension-controls.jpg}
\end{dunefigure}

\item Winder interface arm design: The current winder interface only allows one-half of a wire plane to be wired at a time. The \dword{apa} frame must be moved to the process cart where the interface arms are flipped 180$^\circ$ to wind the second half of the wire plane.  A new design concept, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:winding-dev}, allows the winder head to pass from one side to the other nearly continuously without removing the frame from the winding machine.  The interface frames are replaced at either end by retractable linear guided shafts. These can be withdrawn to allow the winding head to pass around the frame over the full height of the frame. These shafts have conical ends and are in shafts fixed to the internal frame tube to provide guides to location. This design change does not alter the design of the frame itself, but it does allow for rotation in the winding machine. Thus, it should also be possible to carry out board installation, gluing, and soldering in the winding machine. This eliminates any transfer of the \dword{apa} to the process cart for the entire production operation, which is an inherently safer and faster production method because it cuts down on handling the \dword{apa}.

\begin{dunefigure}[Winding machine schematic showing ongoing development]{fig:winding-dev}
{Work is ongoing to modify the wiring machine design to allow an \dword{apa} frame to be rotated without removing it from the frame.  This would reduce the required handling of the frame during fabrication and speed production substantially.}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{sp-apa-winding-machine-design-development.jpg} 
\end{dunefigure}

\item Modular mesh panels: The current approach to mesh installation is slow and cumbersome. We will improve this part of construction by moving toward a modular window screen design that improves the reliability of the installed mesh (more uniform tension across the mesh) and allows much easier installation on the \dword{apa} frame.

\fixme{Can you please check the following paragraph? I was interrupted while working on it, and I'm afraid it's not accurate any more.}

\item Epoxy process improvements: Applying epoxy during the construction process requires many steps. These steps require careful work and many hours between winding each successive wire plane as the epoxy cures. We already have concepts for improving epoxy application jigs from \dword{pdsp}, and we will investigate whether epoxy pre-forms or accelerated heat curing can improve time or reliability.

\item Automated soldering: Every solder joint on the six \dword{pdsp} \dwords{apa} was done by hand. We will investigate automated soldering techniques to improve the process and reduce the amount of manual effort required. 

\item Wire tension measurement techniques: Verifying wire tension during construction is an important, but time consuming, process. The current technique uses a laser photodiode tool mounted on the winder to measure tension one wire at a time. This takes many hours for each wire plane. Collaborators at the University of Manchester are developing techniques to electronically measure groups of \num{20} or more wires at one time. This technique provides much faster tension measurements and shorter turnaround between wire planes. 

\item Winder maintenance plan: The approach to winder maintenance during \dword{pdsp} construction was not well considered. As a result, winding machine problems traceable to lack of routine maintenance occurred from time to time, shutting the production line down until repair or maintenance was performed. We will formulate a routine and preventive maintenance plan that minimizes winder downtime during \dword{apa} production.
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Construction Facilities}
\label{sec:fdsp-apa-prod-facility}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Construction of \dword{spmod} \dwords{apa} will take place in both the USA and the UK. Daresbury Lab \fixme{from Nora: Lab should be spelled out wherever it occurs. This could be a find/fix type of correction because scientists often abbreviate laboratory without thinking about it.} in the UK will house multiple production lines, one of which already exists from \dword{pdsp}. In the USA, we anticipate setting up production lines  at the University of Chicago, Yale University, and the already existing production facility at the University of Wisconsin, PSL. At least eight \dword{apa} production lines spread over several facilities will provide some margin on the production schedule and provide back up in the event that technical problems occur at any particular site. 
%\fixme{specified future partner sites}

The space requirements for each production line are driven by the size of the \dword{apa} frames and the winding robot used to build them. The approximate dimensions of a class \num{100000} clean space needed to house winder operations and associated tooling is \SI{175}{m$^2$}. The estimated requirement for inventory, work in progress, and completed \dwords{apa} is about \SI{600}{m$^2$}. Each facility  also needs temporary access to shipping and crating space of about \SI{200}{m$^2$}. Possible floor layouts at each institution are being developed. Adequate space is available at each site, and the institutions have offered commitments for space for DUNE. 

%\begin{dunefigure}[Conceptual layouts of \dword{apa} factories]{fig:factories}
%{Possible factory layouts at (clockwise from upper left) PSL, University of Chicago, Daresbury Lab, and Yale University, with two to four winders at each site.}

%%\includegraphics[height=0.27\textheight]{Yale-WL-2\dword{apa}.png}
%%\includegraphics[height=0.27\textheight]{UK-production-factory-layout.jpg} 
%\end{dunefigure}

The University of Wisconsin has space available in the Physical Sciences Laboratory, Rowe Technology Center. Part of the facility has been used for the past two years for the \dword{pdsp} project. Approximately \SI{20000}{ft$^2$} (\SI{1850}{m$^2$}) is available for DUNE, and the current clean tent can possibly be expanded to house another production line. 

\dword{pdsp} construction has also taken place at Daresbury Laboratory.  The current facility cannot accommodate multiple production lines, but the ``Inner Hall'' on the Daresbury site has been identified as an area that is large enough to be used for DUNE \dword{apa} construction. It has good access and crane coverage throughout. Daresbury Laboratory management have agreed that the area is available, but a safe working environment will require some investment. Preparation for construction is underway, clearing the current area of existing facilities, obsolete cranes, and ancillary equipment. The renovation of a plant room is also planned, so it can be used for storage and as a shipping area. This work is ongoing. The production factory is being designed to hold four winding machines and associated process equipment and tooling. 

The Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of Chicago and the Wright Laboratory at Yale University each have the necessary infrastructure to house up to two \dword{apa} production lines. Development work relevant for local planning at each site has begun at those institutions as well.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Material Supply}  
\label{sec:fdsp-apa-prod-supply}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Ensuring the reliable supply of raw materials and parts for each factory is critical to keeping \dword{apa} production on schedule through the years of construction. Here the consortium institutions are pivotal in taking responsibility for delivery of \dword{apa} sub-elements at each factory. Supplier institutions will be responsible for sourcing, inspection, cleaning, testing, quality assurance, and delivery of hardware to each factory. 

\begin{itemize}

\item Frame construction: We envision two sources of frames: one in the USA and one in the UK. The institutions responsible will rely on many lessons learned from \dword{pdsp}. The effort requires specialized resources and skills, including a large assembly area, certified welding capability, large scale metrology tools and experience, and large scale tooling and crane support. We are considering two approaches for sourcing: one is to outsource to an industrial supplier; the other is to procure all the major machined and welded components and then assemble and survey in-house. Material suppliers have been identified and used with good results on \dword{pdsp}.

\item Mesh supply and construction: Elsewhere in this proposal, we describe the current mesh installation procedure. However, our \dword{pdsp} experience leads us to believe that moving to smaller self-supporting \textit{window screen} panels may save assembly time and improve overall \dword{apa} quality. We have an excellent source of mesh that was used on \dword{pdsp}.

\item Wire procurement: Wire is a significant element in the assembly of an \dword{apa}. Approximately \SI{24}{km}| of wire is wound onto each unit. During \dword{pdsp}, %we have worked with 
an excellent supplier %that 
has worked with us to provide high quality wire wound onto spools that we provide. These spools are then used directly on the winder head with no additional handling or re-spooling required. Wire samples from each spool are strength tested before use.

\item Comb procurement: Each institution will either work with our existing comb supplier or find other suppliers who can meet our requirements. The \dword{pdsp} supplier has been very reliable.

\item Wire wrapping board procurement: One or more consortium institutions will take on the responsibility of supplying wire-wrapping board. The side and foot boards are unique to suppliers because they have electrical traces and provide wire placement support through a separately bonded tooth strip. The \num{150} \dwords{apa} require \num{276} boards per \dword{apa}, or \num{41400} boards total. The institutions responsible for boards will spend time working with several vendors to reduce risk and ensure quality. 

\item Capacitor resistor boards: These boards are unique given their thickness, 
\dword{hv} components, and leakage current requirements. A reliable source of bare boards was found for \dword{pdsp}. Assembly and testing was performed at PSL. We will conduct a more exhaustive search for vendors willing to take on assembly and testing for the \num{3000} plus boards needed for DUNE.

\item Winders and tooling: We propose that PSL and Daresbury work together to supply tooling and winding machines for additional production lines at new locations and for additional lines in-house. This natural collaboration has been in place for nearly two years for \dword{pdsp}.

\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Quality Control in APA Production}
\label{sec:fdsp-apa-prod-qc}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A key part of \dword{qa} for the \dword{apa} design and manufacturing procedures is the experience with \dword{pdsp}, including upcoming operations and data analysis results from the detector.  We have already learned much about design, component testing, and fabrication procedures that will help in formulating the detailed design and plans for the %DUNE 
\dword{apa} construction project over the next year.  The set of final design drawings and detailed procedures documentation generated over the next year leading to the \dword{tdr} represent an important element of the \dword{qa} plan for fabricating the \dwords{apa}.  

Summaries of all \dword{qa} testing performed on elements used in the final design of the \dwords{apa} will also be prepared for the \dword{tdr}.  Much data already exists, and again, \dword{pdsp} will provide valuable additional information on the robustness of the detector components and construction.  


\subsubsection{Incoming Inspections}

Some components require inspection and \dword{qc} checks before use on an \dword{apa}. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Frame components: If \dword{apa} steel frames are produced in-house, then upon receipt of the rectangular hollow section steel for the frames, a selection procedure is followed to choose the sections of the steel most suited to achieving the geometrical tolerances. 
\item Wire testing: The CuBe wire is provided on spools from the supplier. Samples from each spool are strength tested before use on an \dword{apa}.
\item Circuit boards: All circuit boards installed on an \dword{apa} are inspected for dimensional accuracy before being routed through various epoxy and cleaning processes as they are prepped for assembly. Inspection results are documented, and if anomalies are found, an electronic non-conformance report is written.  %Materials that can be re-worked to become conforming are set aside from inventory and re-worked.  If the material cannot be made usable, the material is kept in a non-conforming area sequestered from usable inventory.   
\item CR and $G$-plane bias board testing: Acceptance tests of these boards include leakage current measurements ($<$\SI{0.5}{nA}) and continuity tests on each channel.  The tests are performed at room temperature. \dword{pdsp} was used to perform design validation on more than \num{100} boards that were cycled and tested at LN temperature. No failures were seen during these tests. 
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{\dword{apa} Acceptance Tests} 

The following are examples of quality control data to be collected for each \dword{apa} during production:  

\begin{itemize}
\item Frame flatness: A laser survey measures the flatness of the assembled bare frame. Three sets of data are compiled into a map that shows the amount of bow, twist, and fold in the frame. Each of these parameters is compared to an allowable amount that does not cause wire plane-to-plane spacing to be out of tolerance ($\pm$\SI{0.5}{mm}).  A visual file is created for each \dword{apa} from measured data. A final frame survey is completed after all electrical components have been installed, and the as-built plane-to-plane separations are measured to verify the distance between adjacent wire planes.
\item Mesh to frame connection: To confirm sufficient electrical contact between these two components, a resistance measurement is taken in each of \num{20} zones of mesh bounded by the outside frame perimeter and the four cross beam ribs. This measurement is completed immediately after mesh install before any winding.
\item Wire tension: The tension of each wire is measured after each new plane of wires is installed on an \dword{apa}. The optimal target tension is still under discusion (it was \SI{5}{N} in \dword{pdsp}), as are the necessary tolerances.  \Dword{pdsp} data, where the tensions have substantial variation, will provide important data for quantifying the effects of varying tensions.  
%Wire tensions must be in the range 3.5--\SI{7.5}{N} for wires longer than \SI{750}{mm} and in the range 2.0--\SI{7.5}{N} for wires shorter than \SI{750}{mm}.
%\item Cleanliness: \dwords{apa} are produced inside a class 100,000 clean area.  Particle counts are completed daily to verify cleanliness of the assembly area.  If counts fall outside expected limits, measures are taken to re-clean the affected area and check with another particle count.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Documentation} 
\label{sec:fdsp-apa-prod-doc}

Each \dword{apa} is delivered with a traveler document in which specific assembly information is gathered, initially by hand on a paper copy, then entered into an electronic version for longer term storage.  The traveler database contains a detailed log of the production of each \dword{apa}, including where and when the \dword{apa} was built and the origin of all parts used in its construction. 

Assembly issues that arise during the construction of an \dword{apa} are gathered in an issue log for each \dword{apa}, and separate short reports provide details of what caused the occurrence, how the issue was immediately resolved, and what measures should be taken in the future to ensure the specific issue has a reduced risk of occurring.
