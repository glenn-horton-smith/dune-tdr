This section summarizes the most important sets of measurements, completed, ongoing and planned, that validate the \dword{pds} design. The first subsection summarizes the extensive work on the original \dword{sarapu} design, which has wavelength-shifter coated onto two sides of the dichroic filter window. The next subsection describes current and ongoing tests of the baseline \dword{xarapu}, which replaces the inner coating with a wavelength-shifter doped plate. The final subsections address the materials validation and monitoring system.

%\subsection{Small-Scale Standard ARAPUCA Prototypes}
\subsection{Standard ARAPUCA (S-ARAPUCA)}
\label{sec:sarapuca-prototypes}

As outlined in Section~{sssec:photoncollectors}, the initial ARAPUCA design has a window on which one wavelength-shifter is coated on the external side facing the \lar active volume and a second wavelength shifter is coated onto the dichroic filter on the inner surface of the window.  
The first ARAPUCA proof-of-concept measurements were performed on a small cell with internal dimensions of \SI{3.5}{cm} $\times$ \SI{2.5}{cm} $\times$ \SI{0.6}{cm}, with a window formed from a dichroic filter of  dimensions \SI{3.5}{cm} $\times$ \SI{2.5}{cm} and a wavelength cut-off at \SI{400}{nm}. The external side was coated with \dword{ptp} and internal side was coated with \dword{tpb}. 
%was evaporated onto the internal side of the filter where it absorbs the shifted \SI{350}{nm} photons and re-emits at \SI{430}{nm}. 
The trapped light was detected by a single \SI{0.6}{cm} $\times$ \SI{0.6}{cm} SensL \dword{sipm} mod C60035\footnote{http://sensl.com/products/c-series/}. The cell was exposed to scintillation light produced by an alpha source\footnote{A $^{238}$U-Al alloy in the form of a metallic foil emitting three alpha lines with energies of  \SI{4.187}{MeV}, \SI{4.464}{MeV} and  \SI{4.759}{MeV} with relative abundances of 48.9\%, 2.2\% and 48.9\% respectively.} in pure LAr. A detection efficiency of 1.10\%$\pm$0.15\% was measured~\cite{Segreto:2018jdx} for this configuration, consistent with \dword{mc} expectations~\cite{Marinho:2018doi}.

%\label{sec:proof-principle}
%\fixme{in some of these you say when and where the measurements were made, but not in others. Suggest all or none. Anne}

%ARAPUCA prototypes with different configurations have been tested in \lar at multiple facilities. In each case, the first wavelength shift of \SI{127}{nm} scintillation photons down to \SI{350}{nm} that can pass through the filter substrate was performed by p-TerPhenyl (pTP) evaporated onto the outside of a dichroic filter window. 

%The first prototype was made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) with internal dimensions of \SI{3.5}{cm} $\times$ \SI{2.5}{cm} $\times$ \SI{0.6}{cm}, a window formed from a dichroic filter of  dimensions \SI{3.5}{cm} $\times$ \SI{2.5}{cm} and a wavelength cut-off at \SI{400}{nm}. 
%Tetraphenyl-butadiene (\dword{tpb}) was evaporated onto the internal side of the filter where it absorbs the shifted \SI{350}{nm} photons and re-emits at \SI{430}{nm}. Trapped light was detected by a single \SI{0.6}{cm} $\times$ \SI{0.6}{cm} SensL \dword{sipm} mod C60035\footnote{http://sensl.com/products/c-series/}.
%The device was installed inside a vacuum-tight stainless-steel cylinder closed by two CF100 flanges. The cylinder was deployed inside a \lar open bath, vacuum pumped down to a pressure around  10$^{-6}$~\si{mbar} and then filled with one liter of ultra-pure \lar\footnote{Argon 6.0, less than \SI{1}{ppm} total residual contamination.}. 
%Scintillation light emission was produced by an alpha source\footnote{A $^{238}$U-Al alloy in the form of a metallic foil emitting three alpha lines with energies of  \SI{4.187}{MeV}, \SI{4.464}{MeV} and  \SI{4.759}{MeV} with relative abundances of 48.9\%, 2.2\% and 48.9\% respectively.} installed in front of the ARAPUCA immersed in \lar. Signals were read out through an Aquiris\footnote{Aquiris High-Speed Digitizer products; http://www.acqiris.com/.} PCI board and stored on a computer.

%%%The detection efficiency of the ARAPUCA was calculated by determining the number of detected photoelectrons corresponding to the end point of the $\alpha$ spectrum and comparing that with the expected number of photons impinging on the acceptance window for that energy value (\SI{4.267}{MeV}).  

%The total energy spectrum of the $\alpha$ particles is made by the superposition of three mono-energetic sources with infinite thicknesses. Each spectral line is modeled with the convolution of an exponential low-energy tail with a Gaussian distribution and the total spectrum is fitted with the sum of the three lines.
%%%with the equation:

%%%\begin{equation}
%%%F(E) = \sum_{i=1}^{3} f(E-\mu_i;\sigma,\tau)=\sum_{i=1}^{3}\frac{A_i}{2\tau}\exp\Bigg(\frac{E-\mu_i}{\tau}+\frac{\sigma^2}{2\tau^2}\Bigg)\erfc\Bigg(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Bigg(\frac{E-\mu_i}{\sigma}+\frac{\sigma}{\tau}\Bigg)\Bigg)
%%%\end{equation}
%%%where $\mu_i$ is the energy of the {\it i}-th peak (in photoelectrons), A$_i$ is the area of the {\it i-th} peak, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian and $\tau$ is the tailing parameter. 

%This has been shown to be  one of the most successful analytical models to represent the shape of an alpha spectrum composed by one or multiple lines. The fit procedure allows to extract the number of photo-electrons corresponding to the energy of each line.
%
%The number of photons impinging on the acceptance window can be estimated analytically.   This calculation depends only on known properties of \lar and on the solid angle subtended by the ARAPUCA window. A detection efficiency at the level of 1.10\%$\pm$ 0.15\% was measured~\cite{Segreto:2018jdx}, consistent with \dword{mc} expectations for this configuration~\cite{Marinho:2018doi}.

%\metainfo{New content: Gustavo}

% rjw 4/8/19 Summary of Multi-cell measurements
In the next phase of prototyping, eight prototype \dword{sarapu} cells with filters from different manufacturers, different reflectors, and different dimensions were tested in the \dword{tallbo} facility at Fermilab. 
%early 2017 
%%%Per Gustavo 12/4/18 
The cells each contained two \SI{6}{mm} $\times$ \SI{6}{mm} SensL MicroFC-60035C-SMT \dwords{sipm}.  
%Measurements were made both with an $^{241}$Am alpha source and with cosmic rays. 
%An $^{241}$Am source, mounted on a movable holder that allowed placement in front of each prototype, provided the scintillation light. 
The measured detection efficiencies with an $^{241}$Am alpha source \dword{sarapu} ranged from 0.4\% to 1.0\%.

%%%%%%%  
%%%The TallBo facility at Fermilab provides a \SI{450}{liter} capacity cryostat with \SI{56}{cm} inner diameter and up to a \SI{183}{cm} liquid depth that accommodates  up to three different PD modules with dimensions \todo{how different?} close to the real ones.

%Eight prototype \dword{sarapu} cells with filters from different manufacturers, different reflectors, and different dimensions were tested in early 2017 using the \dword{tallbo} facility at Fermilab.  
%%%Per Gustavo 12/4/18 
%The \dword{sarapu} cells each contained two \SI{6}{mm} $\times$ \SI{6}{mm} SensL \dwords{sipm}. 
%An $^{241}$Am source, mounted on a movable holder that allowed placement in front of each prototype, provided the scintillation light. The measured detection efficiencies of these \dword{sarapu} ranged from 0.4\% to 1.0\%.

%% Keep the following text for reference.
%In late 2017 we measured an array of eight \dword{sarapu} cells together with two reference bars of a double-shift light guide design. An array of counters on opposite sides of the cryostat formed a cosmic ray trigger. 
%Two configurations of trigger selected through-going muons that pass through the cryostat at mean angles ranging from $36^{\circ} $ to $70^{\circ} $ from vertical, and from $65^{\circ} $ to $90^{\circ} $ from vertical, with each angle accepting approximately $\pm 3^{\circ}$ about the mean. The possible array combination along with the muons flux angular dependence produces a non-symmetrical distribution of the muons in zenith angle: for the first configuration the mean angle was $46^{\circ}$ and for the second configuration $75^{\circ}$; 90\% of events are in a range of $\pm 10^{\circ}$ from the means value in both cases.
%The expected light production was adjusted for the crossing angle but the angular acceptance of the trigger introduces a spread in the expected number of photos of about 10\% (between 6\% and 15\% depending on the track).

%%% The so-called ``hi-low'' trigger selected through-going muons at a few degrees away from vertical.

%%%\subsection{Efficiency analysis}
%%%\textit{\it TallBo Measurement Efficiency analysis}

%We define the detector efficiency as the ratio between the number of measured photons and the estimated number of photons arriving at each \dword{sarapu} cell:
%%%\begin{equation}
%$\mathcal{R}_{i}=\frac{PE_i}{PH_i}$.
%%%\end{equation} 
%In addition to this metric, the ratio between the total number of photoelectrons measured in all the \dwords{sarapu} divided by the total number of photons landing on them is also calculated. 
%%%\begin{equation}
%$\mathcal{R}_{TOT}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^8PE_i}{\sum_{i=1}^8PH_i}$
%%%\end{equation} 

%%%Simplify to just the one reported on. 
%%%Three kinds of analyses were performed on these datasets and produced similar results: (1)  a log-normal fit above the ratio values $\mathcal{R}_{TOT} $ and $\mathcal{R}_{i}$, taking into account the median of the distribution;  (2) a robust statistic procedure, getting the median of the data set cleaned out by the outliers given by the median absolute deviation (\cite{stats-rous+hub}; \{RousseeuwHubert_RobustStatisticsForOutlierDetection_WIREs_2011 should be cited} Rousseeuw Peter J., Hubert Mia.

%%% email sent to Luke Corwin to see if he can make the entries in the bib file

%Using the trigger information, muons with a path passing entirely in front of the \dword{sarapu} cells windows were selected.
%A bootstrap procedure \cite{stats-diaconis-efron-1983} was used to evaluate the average $\mathcal{R}_{TOT} $ and $\mathcal{R}_{i}$ values on a reduced selection of events for which there were a strong correlation in the response of each ARAPUCA, relying on the Pearson correlation coefficient condition: $r\,>\,0.7$. Two other analysis methods were used that gave compatible results. 

%%%Here are reported only the ones given by the third procedure since the range of errors is the smaller.

%Figure~\ref{fig:pds-tallbo-arapuca} displays the mean of the set of average values obtained from the measured photon distributions using the bootstrap procedure.
%The green points are for muons with a zenith angle of $\sim 46^{\circ}$ and the purple points are muons centered on $\sim 75^{\circ}$.
%The first three ARAPUCAs were not used in the low angle configuration since they were far enough from the volume where the tracks were triggered that they were exposed to only a few hundred photons so the number of measured photons were of the order of 1 - 10 and the ratio estimation had a large statistical fluctuation. 
 
%The $x$-axis is the \dword{sarapu} cell number, except number 0, labels the results for all cells combined; the $y$-axis is the detection efficiency. The two configuration are in agreement after the energy deposit value has been corrected for track angle: \SI{2.2}{MeV/cm} to $\sim\,$\SI{3.0}{MeV/cm} passing from the $\sim\,46^{\circ}$ to $\sim\,75^{\circ}$ configuration, respectively.
%The horizontal configuration shows larger error because the total number of events was much less than the higher angle configuration.

%The TallBo experiment showed that \dwords{sarapu} with only four \dwords{mppc} %with  covering a total area of \SI{1.44}{cm$^2$} and a photon collection area of \SI{80}{cm$^2$} achieved close to 1\% absolute efficiency (the range of values for the eight ARAPUCA cells is 0.72\%--0.80\%). The effective ARAPUCA gain is about 4.5 times the photosensor area.

%In late 2017 
For the final set of prototypes prior to \dword{pdsp}, we measured an array of eight \dword{sarapu} cells each with a photon collection area of \SI{80}{cm$^2$} and containing four candidate Hamamatsu S13360-6050VE MPPC \dwords{sipm} with a total area of \SI{1.44}{cm$^2$} in the TallBo facility with an external set of cosmic ray counters as a readout trigger.
%together with two reference bars of a double-shift light guide design. An array of counters on opposite sides of the cryostat formed a cosmic ray trigger. 
The measured detection efficiency range for the eight ARAPUCA cells is 0.72\%--0.80\%. The effective \dword{sarapu} gain is about 4.5 times the photosensor area.

\subsubsection{Photosensors and Active Ganging}
\label{sec:pds-valid-ganging}
%%%\metainfo{Content: Gustavo}
%%%\fixme{11/29/18? Zelimir added this subsection, with Gustavo's material}

As described in Section~\ref{sec:pds-design-ganging}, the active ganging of \dwords{sipm} aims to increase the active photo-detecting area while keeping the number of readout channels at a reasonable number. 
%%%Even when the ARAPUCA has a gain in detector sensitive area, the internal reflectivity of the ARAPUCA is not 100\%, hence more than a single photosensor per ARAPUCA is needed to keep a good photon collection efficiency. 
Several active ganging detectors were designed and tested during 2017-2018. 
The systems were based on an active summing node working in the \lar near the photosensors. Several incarnations of the cold summing node were designed and tested using SensL and Hamamatsu \dwords{sipm}, 
%%%\fixme{\dwords{mppc}?} -- rjw SiPM is the generic name, MPPC is specific to Hamamatsu  %and also 
as were several types of operational amplifiers.
%(OpAmps). 
Some of these designs were tested and validated in the \dword{sarapu} prototype measurements.
%contributed to the March and November 2017 TallBo experiments.  
We describe here only the most recent design that demonstrated that 48 Hamamatsu \dwords{mppc} in the baseline design can be ganged together on a single differential output with excellent signal performance, low noise and low power dissipation.

Figure~\ref{fig:fig-pds-gang-1} (left) shows a matrix array of 72 \dwords{mppc} organized as 12 rows of six  13360-6050VE \dwords{mppc} each. 
The six \dwords{mppc} per row are connected in parallel, giving a total output capacitance of \SI{7.8}{nF}. The 12 rows are connected to the summing node of an operational amplifier, THS4131, as sketched in Figure~\ref{fig:fig-pds-gang-1} (right). 
Since the DUNE baseline design is based on 48 \dwords{mppc}/ARAPUCA module, only eight rows of six were used for the tests. 
The performance of the cold summing electronics was done by illuminating the \dword{mppc} array with an LED and digitizing the output with a high-speed oscilloscope and with the \dword{ssp} readout electronics (see Section~\ref{sec:ssp-protodune-electronics}).

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fig-pds-gang-4}(left), the mean signal has a rise time of \SI{60}{ns} and a recovery time of \SI{660}{ns}, well within the DUNE \dword{pd} specifications.

Figure~\ref{fig:fig-pds-gang-4}(right) shows a histogram of light collection signals from the array for a bias voltage equivalent to \SI{2}{volts} above the mean breakdown voltage. Since there are 48 \dwords{mppc} in the array, and a single common bias, there is a spread in the allowed gains. Even when the Hamamatsu \dwords{mppc} have a small spread in breakdown voltages, that spread is enough to smear the peaks in the histogram. It is worth noting the difference between noise and gain spread. The circuit noise can be measured as FWHM or RMS around the 0 PE signal (\SI{3.5}{ADC counts} in the figure). The first PE peak is at \SI{33}{ADC counts}, resulting in an optimal signal to noise ratio of about 10.

Since the breakdown voltage of the \dwords{mppc} is specified by the manufacturer, the gain spread can be reduced by picking groups of 48 \dwords{mppc} with similar breakdown values for each module. The differential output of the cold electronics impedance is matched to the readout electronics and able to reject more than \SI{60}{dB} of common mode noise. This is particularly important since the \dwords{mppc} and output wiring are inside a high voltage TPC. The timing properties of the 48 ganged electronics were also measured 
in LAr using a Am-241 alpha source. 
Figure~\ref{fig:fig-pds-gang-4} shows the time walk for a constant discrimination threshold which, as expected, is not a linear function of the signal height. The error distribution, which is not Gaussian, has a FWHM of \SI{80}{ns}. This value is well within the DUNE specification (Table~\ref{tab:specs:SP-PDS}).

The Mu2e electronics have undergone a number of end-to-end warm and cold tests to demonstrate single-photon sensitivity in various parallel/series ganging and \dword{sipm}/\dword{mppc} configurations. Here we summarize the results with the 72-\dword{mppc} active ganging array described in Section~\ref{sec:pds-valid-ganging}
%%%(Vb = 47.2 V; each of 12~rows of 6x6 mm$^2$ Hamamatsu S13360-6050VE \dwords{mppc} in parallel, with total capacitance of 7.8 nF per row) 
at liquid nitrogen temperatures. 
%%%This active ganging system, discussed in Section~\ref{}, is designed to mimic the arrangement envisioned for DUNE, although the DUNE \dword{pd} active ganging scheme will feature 48~\dwords{mppc} rather than 78. 
A balun is used to convert from the differential \dword{mppc} array output to the single-ended \dword{feb}. The data represent triggers in time with an LED flasher, with samples taken every 12.5~ns for the length of the readout window ($\sim$3~$\mu$s in this case). Figure~\ref{fig:pds-board-balun-adc} shows the system used and a histogram of the maximum ADC value during each trigger window. The first peak above zero represents noise and the second peak represents a one-PE signal. The signal to noise from these tests was measured to be 4, determined by the ratio of the single photon peak (20 ADC, after subtracting the noise peak) to the spread in the noise ($\sigma_{noise}$ = 5~ADC) for direct comparison to the \dwords{ssp} (S/N = 5).

\subsubsection{\dword{pdsp}}
\label{sec:valid-pdsp}

The most comprehensive set of data on the \dword{sarapu} will come from the fully instrumented modules in the \dword{pdsp} experiment~\cite{Abi:2017aow} that completed first beam running in November \num{2018}. 
Since \dword{pdsp} will remain filled with \lar for much of the CERN long-shutdown we will also have a long-term cold test of full-scale \dword{pd} modules for the first time so it may be possible to quantify any deterioration in their performance.
%such as the loss of \dword{tpb} from the coating noted previously. 
%More broadly, aging effects in various detectors technologies, such as scintillator and \dwords{pmt}, are well documented, and knowledge of such effects is required at the design stage so that the photon detection performance will meet minimum requirements for the whole life of the experiment.

Three photon collector designs are present in \dword{pdsp}: \num{29} double-shift guides, \num{29} dip-coated guides, and two \dword{sarapu} arrays. 
The TPC provides precise reconstruction in \threed of the track of any ionizing event inside the active volume and matching the track with the associated light signal will enable an accurate comparison of the relative detection efficiencies of the different \dword{pd} modules. 
The large number of modules and independent channels that record each event can be used to constrain the propagation parameters of the \lar that regulate \dword{vuv} light propagation in the simulation and are poorly determined in the literature. %such as Rayleigh scattering length
In principle, absolute calculations are also possible using \dword{mc} simulations.
The absolute precision of this approach may be limited by the precision of the constraints on the parameters, but will result in a consistent simulation constrained by actual measurements. 

%The first large-scale implementation of an \dword{sarapu} module, in \dword{pdsp}, is composed of an array of sixteen cells.
%The \dword{sarapu} design collects light from one side of the box through an optical window formed by a dichroic filter deposited with a layer of pTP\footnote{p-TerPhenyl, supplier: Sigma-Aldrich\textregistered.}
% https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/substance/pterphenyl230309294411.} 
%wavelength shifter on the external surface. This shifts the incident \dword{vuv} light to a near-visible frequency that is able to pass through the filter plate to the interior of the box.  

%In the \dword{pdsp} version of \dword{sarapu}, the inner surface of the box opposite the window houses an array of \dwords{sipm} that covers a small fraction of the area of the window (2.8-5.6\%), surrounded by a foil of a highly reflective material coated with a second wavelength shifter, \dword{tpb}. The \dword{tpb} converts the light passing through the filter to a wavelength that is reflected by the filter. It has been shown in simulation and in prototypes that a large fraction of these trapped photons, reflecting from the filter and the lined walls of the box, will eventually fall on a \dword{sipm} and be detected.

Of the two \dword{sarapu} arrays in \dword{pdsp}, the first is installed in the \dword{apa} \#3 in the fourth position from the top, near the level the beam particles enter this drift volume. This module and the surrounding light guide modules are illuminated with a significant amount of light from each beam particle interaction.
The second is installed in the \dword{apa} \#6 in the 6th position from the top.  This module does not see significant light from beam events, but it is also surrounded by light guide modules, signals from these will help to constrain the light that the module is detecting from each interaction.

\fixme{check description of models}
Each \dword{pdsp} \dword{sarapu} module array is composed of sixteen cells, where each cell is an \dword{sarapu} box with dimensions of \SI{8}{cm} $\times$ \SI{10}{cm}; half of the cells have twelve \dwords{mppc} installed on the bottom side of the cell and  half have six \dwords{mppc}. The \dwords{mppc} used are the Hamamatsu model 13360-6050CQ-SMD, which are functionally the same as the 13360-6050VE used for the ganging tests (Section~\ref{sec:pds-valid-ganging}) and some of the lightguide bars in \dword{pdsp} but has a special package specifically designed for cryogenic operation\footnote{A thin glass window is mounted in front of uncoated silicon photosensitive surface, as opposed to the thin epoxy coating used on the 13360-6050VE.}. 
The \dwords{mppc} have active dimensions \SI{0.6}{cm}$\times$\SI{0.6}{cm} and account for 5.6\% (\num{12} \dwords{mppc}) or \num{2.8}\% (\num{6} \dwords{mppc}) of the area of the window (\SI{7.8}{cm}$\times$\SI{9.8}{cm}).
The \dwords{mppc}  are passively ganged together, so that only one readout channel is needed for each \dword{sarapu} grouping of \num{12} \dwords{mppc} (the boxes with six \dwords{mppc} are ganged together to form \num{12}-\dword{mppc} units) so a total of \num{12} channels is required per module. 
%Studies are underway to investigate active ganging that would permit combining signals from multiple boxes, as required to reduce the number of electronics channels and cables under the working assumption that the \single \dword{pds} is restricted to four readout channels per \dword{pd} module. 
The total width of a module is \SI{9.6}{cm}, while the active width of an \dword{sarapu} is \SI{7.8}{cm}, the length is the same as the light guide modules (\SI{210}{cm})\footnote{Since \dword{pdsp} was constructed, the slot opening in the \dword{apa} opening for \dword{pd} module installation has been enlarged allowing for a module with larger collection area}.

\fixme{check the numbers in this paragraph - should 1.8\% -> 1.1\% from the first section (and update the other numbers)?}

%An \dword{sarapu} array during assembly is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sarapuca_array_prod}; the array installed in \dword{pdsp} is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:arapuca-protodune}. If the \dword{sarapu} cells achieved the same detection efficiency as earlier prototypes (up to 1.8\%, see Section\ref{sec:sarapuca-prototypes}), they would give an average light yield of \SI{13}{PE/MeV}, meaning a full \dword{sarapu} module would have an effective area equivalent to a detector with \SI{23}{cm$^2$} active area with 100\% detection efficiency.

The electronics readout of the \dword{pdsp} \dword{pds} was provided by a sophisticated custom-designed system, the \dword{sipm} Signal Processor (\dwords{ssp})~\citedocdb{3126} that was also used extensively for most of the earlier prototyping studies and photosensor testing.
A passive signal summing scheme with three \dwords{sipm} summed together was chosen for the light guides (four \dword{ssp} channels for each bar) and groups of twelve \dwords{sipm} are passively summed for the two ARAPUCA modules (12 \dwords{ssp} channels per module).
The unamplified analog signals from the \dwords{sipm} are transmitted directly to outside the cryostat for processing and digitization. The \dword{ssp} consists of 12 readout channels packaged in 
a self-contained 1U module. The ProtoDUNE \dword{pds} is read out with the total of 288 \dwords{ssp} channels.

%\fixme{LMM 1/13/2018 I'm just going to fix the text below, I left this fixme here thinking it was Zelimir's words and needed fixing.  I'm not seeing anything happening, so I'll just fix it.  -- This was my comment: The triggering here is not really correct for how it was done at protodune.  The module continually digitizes (always) and stores waveforms above threshold in a circular buffer.  On an external trigger, it will send a waveform and header for the time period of the trigger and any stored waveforms or subsequent waveforms above threshold for the configured readout window. For protoDUNE it always send header and waveform, and in all cases if it sends a waveform it will send a header. I'm not sure where the following paragraph comes from? I didn't want to rewrite without knowing where it came from}

%commented here is the original(?) text
%In the standard mode of operation, the module performs waveform capture, using either an external or internal trigger. In the latter case the module self-triggers to capture only waveforms with an amplitude greater than a specified threshold. In \dword{pdsp} the photon readout is configured to read waveforms when triggered by a beam event, or to provide header information when self-triggered by cosmic muons.
%The header portion summarizes pulse amplitude, integrated charge, and time-stamp information of events. The \dword{ssp} for \dword{pdsp} uses \si{Gb} Ethernet 
%communication implemented over an optical interface. The \SI{1}{Gb/s} Ethernet supports full TCP/IP protocol.  Advanced on-board FPGAs are utilized for signal processing (ARTIX-7) and trigger/timing communication (Zynq).

In the standard mode of operation, the module continually digitizes the input signals at \num{150}{MSPS} for each channel.  If a threshold is configured on a channel the \dword{ssp} stores any waveform that meets the trigger condition.  This is called an internally triggered waveform. In an externally triggered waveform the module, the configured waveform window at the time of the external trigger is also stored.  This externally triggered waveform and any internally triggered waveform in the buffer window and any subsequent internally triggered waveforms are transmitted to the DAQ board reader processes for storage. The photon readout is configured to trigger on signals from the central trigger board for a variety of configurable events, beam events, externally triggered cosmic muons from the cosmic ray tagger, periodic triggering, random triggering, or any combination of these.

%The module includes a separate 12-bit high-voltage DAC for each channel to provide bias to each \dword{sipm}. Currently there are two DAC options:  one with a voltage range of 0V to 30V, used with 11 the sensL \dwords{sipm} (17 of the 24 \dword{ssp} units); and the other with a range 0V to 60V for use with the 12 Hamamatsu \dwords{mppc} (seven of the 24 \dword{ssp} units).
%The \dword{ssp}  provides a trigger output signal from internal discriminators in firmware based on programmable coincidence logic, with a standard ST fiber interface to the central trigger board (CTB).
%Input signals are provided to CTB from the beam instrumentation, the \dwords{ssp}, and the beam TOF system. The CTB receives timing information from the \dword{pdsp} timing system and the CTB trigger inputs are distributed to the experiment via the timing system.
%To that end, the \dword{ssp} implements the timing receiver/transmitter endpoint hardware to receive trigger inputs and clock signals from the timing system.

%Other readout components, aside from the \dword{fe} electronics (\dwords{ssp}) included design and implementation of signal feed-through, selection and fabrication.

\textit{\Dword{pdsp} \dword{pds} Measurements}

%\fixme {lmm ProtoDUNE analysis strategy outline.   These enumerated section below will get incorporated into the text as strategy becomes clearer as analysis progresses}
%\fixme{rjw 12/2/18 For now just I think it is better to have just a few words and some of the most relevant results, ideally with a reference to a separate document with all the details :-) (I kept your original text in the file)}

The \dword{pdsp} beam run provides several distinct sets of data for understanding \dword{pds} performance.  
There are data sets with cosmic triggering, randomly, or in coincidence the CRT modules.
There are beam data sets with triggers determined by the beam instrumentation.
There are calibration module data sets, with triggers in coincidence or free running with a configured light pulse. The cosmic ray data and beam data include the TPC and/or CRT information to provide strong constraints on the particle trajectory that will allow us to determine the exposure of each module on an event-by-event basis.  The additional data sets are useful for calibration, and understanding background rates due to other processes.  Beam events also appear to be useful for calibration, as they provide very low level light signals to the modules in the beam-left segment of \dword{pdsp} where the beam particles were not seen directly.

The analysis is ongoing but here we summarize some relevant initial results:
%\fixme{Summarize the key results from ProtoDUNE with emphasis on ARAPUCA and \dword{mppc}.  We should also summarize lightguide  Denver points out, for \dword{xarapu} simulation the results from the IU bars feed into the simulation of the filter/light-trapping from ARAPUCA.  Summarized for beam data with ONLY ARAPUCA  I might be able to add some response of neighbors as well, that might show ARAPUCA is MUCH better}

%\fixme{Include a figure with calibration module pulses seen in different modules, highlighting ARAPUCA and \dword{mppc} channel response.  Maybe just \dword{apa} 5 and 6 with just a few SensL devices, but both an ARAPUCA and many \dword{mppc} bars.  LMM - inlcuding pulser for ARAPUCA is hard.  It looks like the response is much lower than for neighboring bars (wavelength response?)  I don't want that to be misleading.  I may be able to get the beam response of neighboring bars in APA 3 to show a comparison.  It looks like beam is the best bet, and it shows off the difference with the correct wavelength of light for physics.}

The detector has collected data under many different conditions, including a range of energies from the EHN1 beam line.  The black histogram in Figure \ref{fig:arapuca_beamph} shows the summed response of all \dword{sarapu} cells in the module to beam triggered events in \dword{pdsp}.  The pulse height distribution, scaled up \num{12} times for display, from each of the \num{12} channels are shown by the colored histograms.  Differences between the individual channels and the summed histogram are due to geometric effects, light collection, gain, and other variation.  A detailed analysis of each event will help understand and predict the response of photon detectors in a large liquid Argon detector.
Initial work has determined the single avalanche response for each of the \num{256} readout channels in \dword{pdsp}. The correction for this response variation would be less than 10\% and has not been applied to the data shown.
%Not sure if we should show the pe peaks, we don't understand why some are much better than others, so it might be misleading.
%This is part of the information needed to calibrate the response of each channel. In order to fully determine the response the crosstalk must also be measured.  

Figure \ref{fig:arapuca_beamph} shows the pulse height distribution for 4 different beam momenta of \num{1},\num{3},\num{5} and \num{7}{GeV}.
They were from runs \num{4584}, \num{4627}, \num{4624} and \num{4598} respectively, collected before the electron lifetime was long enough to see tracks in the TPC.  As before, the pulse height for each event in the histogram is the sum of the peak amplitude from each of the \num{12} \dword{sarapu} channels in the slot.  All beam events are included. The distribution of particle types will vary with energy, so the distributions are not expected to be identical.  They do show the expected increase with energy in a linear fit to the distribution peaks vs beam momentum.  A full analysis is underway that will take into account the full details recorded for each of the events.

%There are 3 sets of data with distinct features, in all cases the TPC and/or CRT will provide strong constraint on the detailed particle trajectory for measuring exposure of each module on an event by event basis.

%Utilize these sources for their unique features.  Initially one can simply select similar events for all modules.  For example, only select tracks that are within 50cm of the cathode, and vertical.

In this case, relative comparisons could be performed with minimal dependence on any correction factors, geometric or propagation dependent.

%\metainfo{Content: Segreto/Machado}
%\fixme{\color{blue}Ettore: First draft by Warner.  Should be edited and corrected by Segreto/Machado. Second draft edited by Segreto.}

The \dword{xarapu} is an evaluation of \dword{sarapu} concept that moves the second wavelength-shifter from the  inner surface of the dichroic filter to a wavelength-shifter doped plate that acts as a waveguide. This design change was motivated by  simulations that indicate a significant increase in detection efficiency for this configuration. 

In the first subsection we describe in detail the first measurements that demonstrate the validity of the design, followed by several subsections that describes oingoing and fute plans to validate the final design.

\subsubsection{Single Cell \dword{xarapu} Measurements}
\label{sec:xarapuca-unicamp}

The first tests of an \dword{xarapu} cell were made at Unicamp, Brazil at the end of November 2018. 
The structure of the cell used for this test was designed to allow for operation as an \dword{sarapu} or an \dword{xarapu}, with single- or double-sided readout in both configurations.  This flexibility will allow relative and absolute measurements of performance in the same cryostat and so provide a crucial step to validating the baseline design selection.

Building on the experience with the \dword{pdsp} prototypes, the frames for the test cell were fabricated from FR-4 G-10 in a configuration very similar to that planned for the \dword{fd}, but with some small modifications necessitated by the requirements for holding a single-window. The overall dimensions of the cell are \SI{123}{cm}$\times$\SI{100}{cm}$\times$\SI{15.6}{cm}. Figure~\ref{fig:xarapuca-cell} shows an exploded design drawing and the completed cell. 

\begin{dunefigure}[\dword{xarapu} test cell.]{fig:xarapuca-cell}

\end{dunefigure}

%\fixme{\color{blue}Dave: We need larger labels in the right figure.  I will address.  DWW}

The dichroic windows for the prototype are the same size as one of the six windows in a \dword{fd}-design \dword{xarapu} supercell: \SI{10.0}{cm}$\times$\SI{7.8}{cm}. The filter plate was coated with pTP by vacuum evaporation (film thickness $\sim$ \SI{400}{${\mu}$g/cm$^2$})  using an in-house deposition system at Unicamp. The adhesion was tested by soaking the coated filter in liquid nitrogen few times. No detachment of the evaporated film was observed

The wavelength shifting plate in the \dword{xarapu} configuration is made from Eljen EJ-286 blue WLS plate, with dimensions \SI{9.3}{cm}$\times$\SI{7.8}{cm}$\times$\SI{0.3}{cm}.  The side walls of the test cell are lined with Vikuiti reflector, with cutouts at the positions of the photosensors.

\begin{dunefigure}[Coated dichroic filters and vacuum coating system.]{fig:xarapuca-plates}
{Coated dichroic filter plates (left) and Unicamp thin film coating facility (right).} 
	\includegraphics[angle=90, height=6cm]{pds-coated-filter-plates-unicamp}\quad
	\includegraphics[height=7cm]{pds-unicamp-coating-machine}
\end{dunefigure}

The photosensors in the test cell are of the current baseline design:  \SI{0.6}{cm}$\times$\SI{0.6}{cm} Hamamatsu S13360-6050VE \dwords{mppc}.  The photosensors are arranged in the same configuration as in the baseline design, with four \dwords{mppc} (passively ganged) mounted to two sides of the test cell, with positioning relative to the WLS plates and dichroic filters identical to the baseline design.  In a departure from the baseline design, the two passively ganged groups of four \dwords{mppc} are read out separately--no active ganging circuit is implemented for these tests. 

The test cell is installed at the bottom of a  vacuum-tight  stainless-steel cylinder (height $\sim$ \SI{30}{cm)} closed by two CF160 flanges and it is exposed to an alpha source placed at \SI{3}{cm} from the center of the dichroic window. Figure~\ref{fig:xarapu-teststand} shows photos of the test cryostat and the test cell in the support structure; the alpha source holder is visible through the windows.

\begin{dunefigure}[\dword{xarapu} test stand.]{fig:xarapu-teststand}
{Test cryostat at Unicamp (left) and \dword{xarapu} test cell mounting structure (right).  Note the alpha test source in holder.} 
	\includegraphics[height=6cm]{pds-unicamp-test-cryostat} \quad
	\includegraphics[height=7cm]{pds-unicamp-sample-cell-holder}
\end{dunefigure}  

The stainless-steel cylinder  is deployed in a small open dewar which is filled with commercial LAr to act as a thermal bath.
%In order to achieve the highest possible LAr purity inside the \dword{xarapu} chamber, the cylinder was pre-baked and vacuum pumped down to a pressure of \SI{e-5}{mbar}  %\SI{10$^-5$}{mbar} 
%prior to filling it with pure argon (grade 6.0). The level of the liquid was monitored with a level meter and was set to an height able to submerge completely both the alpha source and the \dword{xarapu}. 

The alpha source was exactly the same used in the \dword{sarapu} proof-of-principle tests described in Section~\ref{sec:sarapuca-prototypes}, that is an alloy of natural uranium and aluminum in the form of a metallic disc of \SI{1}{cm} diameter and \SI{150}{$\mu$m} thickness emitting three alpha lines with energies of  \SI{4.187}{MeV}, \SI{4.464}{MeV} and  \SI{4.759}{MeV}. 
%The electronic read-out chain is composed by a custom pre-amplifier (gain $\sim$ 10) and by a commercial CAEN DT5720 desktop digitizer\footnote{https://www.caen.it/products/dt5720/}.

\begin{dunefigure}[Alpha particle energy spectrum.]{fig:xarapu-results}
{The  spectrum of the total number of photo-electrons collected with the alpha source is shown with a black line. The red line is a fit with an analytic description of the spectrum (see text).}

	\includegraphics[height=8cm]{pds-spectrum-fitted-double}
\end{dunefigure}  

%The waveforms detected by the two SiPM arrays are integrated for \SI{10}{$\mu$s}, converted into photo-electrons and summed. 
%The single photo-electron spectra are reconstructed by searching for single photon peaks in  the tail of the recorded waveforms starting from about \SI{15}{\micro\second} from the onset of the scintillation signal. The selected peaks are integrated for \SI{600}{ns} to determine the associated charge. The single \phel spectrum for one of the channels is shown in figure \ref{fig:xarapu-results}, left. The resolution of the single and multi-photon peaks is fairly poor mainly because  four \dwords{sipm} are passively ganged together and because the gain of the pre-amplifier is relatively small. Three different analysis techniques for the extraction of the single \phel spectrum have been implemented and gave similar results.

The spectrum of the detected number of photons is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:xarapu-results}, right with a black line. The same fit procedure adopted for the \dword{sarapu} proof-of-principle tests allows to estimate the number of detected photons for each alpha line. The result of the fit is shown with a red line in Figure~\ref{fig:xarapu-results}. Comparing the number of detected photons with the number of photons impinging on the \dword{xarapu} allows to estimate the global detection efficiency of the device, which results to be $\SI{3.5\pm0.5}{\%}$.

%and returns a number of photo-electrons of $\sim\,$1600 of \phel{}s for the reference alpha line at \SI{4.187}{MeV}. The efficiency is estimated by calculating the number of scintillation photons impinging on the \dword{xarapu} window for the relative alpha line, considering that the source can be well approximated as being point like (the range of \SI{5}{MeV} alphas in \lar is \SI{30}{\micro\meter}) and that the fraction of the solid angle covered by the \dword{xarapu} window is about 0.2. 
%A more precise estimation  will be done with  a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the entire experimental set-up that takes into account the optical properties of all the internal surfaces and materials (e.g., shifting film, filter(s), wavelength shifting plate, internal reflector, stainless-steel internal surfaces, etc.).  The total detection efficiency results to be $\SI{3.5\pm0.5}{\%}$. 

This global detection efficiency translates into an equivalent surface of about \SI{70}{cm$^2$} for an \dword{xarapu} bar, which would exceed the  specifications for our system by a substantial factor (Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-simphys}. The equivalent surface is defined as the product of the acceptance window of the device by its global detection efficiency.

%[Note in 1st draft:  In the coming weeks, absolute detection efficiencies for the double sided readout \dword{xarapu} configuration will be extracted using data collected in these initial tests.  Additional other tests will be performed, including single sided \dword{xarapu} tests (with a Vikuiti reflective foil installed on the non-viewing side of the test cell in place of one of the dichroic window), as well as single- and doubThis global detection efficiency translates into an equivalent surface of about \SI{90}{cm$^2$} for an \dword{xarapu} bar, which would exceed the  specifications for our system by a substantial factor (Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-simphys}.

\subsubsection{ICEBERG Test Stand}
\label{sec:iceberg-teststand}
%\fixme{summary of what PD is going into ICEBERG needed and schedule for when we might expect \dword{xarapu} results}
%\fixme{Description of ICEBERG (described in other chapters? electronics?) and the arapucas that will be in.}
%fixme{Iceberg section added here.  Comments?}
%\fixme{Integrate the mention of Mu2e electronics text from Josh pasted at the end of this section.}

The ICEBERG test-stand is a small-scale TPC using reduced-size \dword{fd} \dword{apa} and cathode designs constructed primarily to provide a platform for DUNE \dword{ce} testing at \dword{fnal}. 
The test stand consists of an approximately \SI{94.7}{cm} $\times$ \SI{79.9}{cm} anode plane assembly, with an approximately \SI{30}{cm} drift length from a cathode plane on each side (Figure~\ref{fig:fig-pds-iceberg-tpc}).  
It can accommodate up to two almost 1/2-length \dword{pd}\footnote{In order to use existing \dword{apa} components from \dword{pdsp} as a cost-saving measure, however, slight modifications were made to the \dword{apa} frame resulting in \dword{pd} modules \SI{50}{mm} shorter than final modules will be, requiring slight modifications to the \dword{pd} module design.} in a mounting structure nearly identical to the final DUNE FD configuration, allowing for testing of \dword{pd} prototype performance, electrical connections, and interfaces with the \dword{ce} and \dword{apa} systems (Figure~\ref{fig:fig-pds-iceberg-supercell}). 
In addition, it will be used to allow comparisons between Mu2e-based warm electronics and \dword{pdsp} \dword{ssp} system, as well as testing newer versions of photosensors active ganging circuit designs.

%The photos are nice but not directly germane to the PD tests.
%Figure~\ref{fig:fig-iceberg} shows the ICEBERG TPC. 

The ICEBERG facility will enable the primary validation of the \dword{xarapu} design prior to a full-scale test envisioned at a future \dword{pdsp} run in 2020. 
%It is envisioned that up to three test cycles will be performed prior to the DUNE technical design report submission.
At least two test campaigns are planned for the ICEBERG TPC with PD modules:  An initial test run is scheduled for February 2019, and incorporates one full-length \dword{sarapu} supercell and one full-length \dword{xarapu} supercell.  Both of these supercells 
%incorporat
use single-sided readout, allowing comparisons of \dword{sarapu} and \dword{xarapu} performance to summer and fall 2018 \dword{pdsp} measurements.

\end{dunefigure}

A second campaign is planned for late spring 2019, incorporating two \dword{sarapu} and two \dword{xarapu} supercells, partially occluded in the frame due to the limitations in \dword{apa} size mentioned above.  One supercell of each kind will be single-sided and one double-sided, allowing for additional comparisons of \dword{pd} technologies.

Along with the \dword{pds} technology studies, the test stand will  provide further testing and validation of the \dword{pds} Mu2e-based electronics system, including a side-by-side comparison with the \dword{pdsp} \dword{ssp} electronics readout. In addition, concurrent data taking with the TPC and light collection system will allow us to study TPC-induced noise on the \dword{pd}, \dword{pd}-induced noise on the TPC, grounding scheme configuration, controller-\dword{daq} and controller-\dword{feb} interfaces, bandwidth and rates issues, online and offline \dword{pd}-TPC interfaces, zero-suppression techniques, firmware development, accepting and producing triggers, and, in general, will inform possible upgrade paths for the system.

\subsubsection{Long Term Cryogenic Aging}
\label{sec:valid-longtermaging}

\forlbnc{As pointed out there are several issues for which there will be no verification of LONGEVITY before installing in DUNE. Are their plans for long term operation of test stands which might aid in diagnostic work should issues arise ten years out??}

It is difficult to accelerate aging effects due to long-term immersion of components in cryogenic liquids.  While accelerated mechanical aging due to thermal expansion/contraction can be readily accelerated by cycling the components to be tested through multiple cycles, long term aging not related to rapid thermal stresses are not amenable to easy acceleration.  An example of such a process might be dissolution of \dword{ptp} coatings over time.

Mitigation of these risks by definition involves long-term exposure to liquid cryogen.  Several such tests are planned for the PD system:

\begin{itemize}

    \item \dword{pdsp} will provide a long-term test of two \dword{sarapu} modules for a period of up to one year at the time of draining in fall 2019.  The system will be continuously monitored for gain and response of the detectors, and will provide information regarding aging of FR-4 G-10 structures, photosensors, and coated filter plates.  Other \dword{pdsp} detectors (Double-shift bar designs) will give some indication of aging of similar \dword{wls} plates to those used in the \dword{xarapu} modules.

    \item SBND will provide a long-term test of many X-ARAPUCA components, including coated filter plates, \dword{wls} plates, photosensors, etc. .  \dword{sbnd} will run for XXX years, starting in YYYY.  The system will be continuously monitored for gain and response of the detectors, and will provide information regarding aging of FR-4 G-10 structures, photosensors, and coated filter plates, and \dword{wls} plates to be used in the \dword{xarapu} modules.
    
    \item \dword{pdsp}-II will provide a long term test of full-scale \dword{xarapu} modules in the final \dword{dune} configuration. While this test will begin shortly before \dword{dune} \dword{pd} module production fabrication, it will provide long-term validation of all \dword{xarapu} components during module production prior to integration into the \dword{apa} frames, allowing for possible insights and improvements into the \dword{xarapu} design.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Materials Selection, Testing and Validation}

\subsubsection{\dword{pd} Module Mechanical Frame}

The APA mechanical frame components are fabricated from FR-4 G-10 (garolite), a glass-epoxy laminate commonly used in printed circuit boards and other mechanical applications where an electrically insulating component with low thermal expansion coefficient is required.  G-10 is widely used in cryogenic applications, including most of the other \dword{dune} subsystems (See \citedocdb{10452}{1} for an extensive discussion in the context of the HV system cathode planes). 

As shown in Table~\ref{tbl:fdsfpdshrink}, the thermal contraction of FR-4 is closely matched with that of stainless steel, simplifying design of the module interface with the \dword{apa} frame.

Selecting FR-4 as our main module structural material comes at some cost in additional difficulty machining components, but allows us to use long printed circuit boards for routing photosensor electrical signals along the detector sides without incurring thermal expansion issues.  As an excellent insulator, FR-4 also simplifies electrically isolating the PD system from the \dword{apa} frame, as required by the \dword{dune} grounding scheme.

FR-4 has been certified at the \dword{fnal} materials test stand as an acceptable material for use in \dword{dune} from the standpoint of \dword{lar} contamination.

All fasteners used in the \dword{pd} are stainless steel alloy 304, widely used in cryogenic applications.  This alloy has also been certified at the \dword{fnal} materials test stand as an acceptable material for use in \dword{dune} from the standpoint of \dword{lar} contamination.

\subsubsection{\dword{pd} Module-\dword{apa} Frame Mechanical Support Structure}

All \dword{pd} mechanical supports (including rails, brackets and fasteners are to be manufactured from stainless steel alloy 304.  This has the benefit of matching thermal contraction coefficients with the \dword{apa} frame and being approved for use in \dword{lar} by the materials test stand.

\subsubsection{Dichroic Filter/Filter coating}

The dichroic filters used in \dword{xarapu} consist of a fused silica substrate, coated on one face to provide the required dichroic properties and on the opposite face with a thin evaporated layer of pTP.

Fused silica was selected in part due to its excellent low-temperature properties.  It is widely used as an optical window in low temperature applications, due to its stability and low coefficient of thermal contraction, and fused silica dichroic filters have performed well in many \dword{sarapu} validation tests.

Testing of the pTP coating is of greater concern.  Initial validation of the \dword{sarapu} in \dword{tallbo}, \dword{pdsp} and in repeated cryogenic immersion tests at \dword{fnal} and other facilities has demonstrated that while it is possible to generate highly-reliable pTP coatings on fused silica substrates, careful surface preparation and deposition procedures are required to prevent catastrophic failure of the coating.  In addition, further studies of diffusion of trace amounts of pTP into the \dword{lar} will also be beneficial.  To facilitate this work,  
Syracuse University is 
 developing a test stand to investigate the long-term stability of \dword{xarapu} optical coatings in liquid argon. Dissolution of similar wavelength-shifting coatings into liquid argon has been recently observed in a technology-dependent fashion~\cite{Asaadi:2018ixs}, so investigation of the designs specific to \dword{dune} is necessary to confirm their robustness. Subjecting coated materials to a continuous flow will also stress the adhesion of the coating to the plates to simulate the convective flow of liquid argon in the far detector cryostat.
 \fixme{TBPdiss was a duplicate. Anne to find the right citation for above.}

The test stand will consist of a \SI{74}{L} liquid argon cryostat. Coated filters and related detector elements will be suspended in a continuous flow of liquid argon and periodically inspected for degradation in their response. A vacuum-ultraviolet monochromator and a dark box containing a visible-light scanning bed will measure wavelength shifting performance of the tested elements before and after suspension within the argon flow.

\subsubsection{\dword{wls} plates}

The \dword{xarapu} wavelength shifting plates are fabricated by the same vendor as the light guide bars utilized in the double-shift \dword{pdsp} modules.  The \dword{xarapu} \dword{wls} plates are made with the same transparent matrix material, but have a different wavelength shifting dopant added.  

While it is possible that the cryogenic properties of this modified \dword{wls} material may be altered by the change in doping agent, it is expected that the tests done for the double-shift bar prototypes are a valuable guide for their expected performance.  As part of the design verification, samples of these bars were manually thermocycled to verify they didn't craze. In addition, we used 
%the Indiana University, USA \laU LAr test stand 
a LAr test stand 
with an alpha source behind a small sample of the \dword{wls} plate to scan the attenuation length of a short sample. Finally, we built a long darkbox with a $\sim\,$~\SI{420}{nm} LED scanning down the length of a full bar to verify its attenuation length and compare to the LAr data. (This is what formed the basis of the threshold requirements on in-air attenuation length measurement for the ProtoDUNE batch.) 
This same sequence will be undertaken for the light guides selected for \dword{xarapu}. 

As with most other components, it is not possible to simulate long-term exposure to \dword{lar} of a length similar to that expected in \dword{dune}, so we will substitute by running samples through repeated thermal cycling to maximize thermal stresses in the material.  Finally, samples of the \dword{wls} plates will be certified for use in \dword{dune} in the the materials test stand at \dword{fnal}.
