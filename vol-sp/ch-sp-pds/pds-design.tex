% Everything in this section is about the 10kt module now
%\subsection{ARAPUCA Configuration in DUNE \SI{10}{kt} }
%\label{sssec:arapuca-dune}



% In practice, this consists of collecting \dword{vuv} photons produced throughout a volume of thousands of cubic-meters (viewing the entire \SI{10}{kt} \lar fiducial mass), converting the photons to longer wavelengths and guiding them onto \dwords{sipm} that are typically less than \SI{1}{cm$^2$} in area. 
%For reference, an array of \num{48} \dwords{sipm} demonstrated a detection efficiency of \SI{13}{\%}, corresponding to an effective area of \SI{2.2}{cm$^2$}. This array, tested in the \fnal \dword{tallbo} \lar facility, consisted of twelve \num{4}$\times$\num{4} units of \SI{3}{mm}$\times$\SI{3}{mm} sensL C-series coated with \SI{100}{$\mu$g/cm$^2$} of \dword{tpb}. 

%A challenge for the \dword{pds} is that a full set of requirements is not yet fully defined for one of the priority physics topics, \dword{snb} neutrinos. So the designs strive to demonstrate that at minimum the requirements for the accelerator neutrino program, atmospheric neutrinos and nucleon decay will be met, while maintaining the flexibility to adjust to the greater demands for the SBN physics.



%In addition, the design has the flexibility to accommodate greater demands, such as might be desired for SBN physics, without major changes to the design and which could be adopted quite late in the final design stages.
%The ARAPUCA concept uses dichroic filter windows to form an effective light trap that increases the efficiency for light collection onto the \dwords{sipm}. %silicon photomultiplier photosensors. 
%A design using this has been adopted for the baseline design. 
% The DUNE Single-Phase Photon Detector Design Report~\citedocdb{11644} provides many additional details on the design too specialized for the scope of this TDR.  
 
%While the ARAPUCA modules deployed in \dword{pdsp} collect light from only one direction, an advanced design called \dword{xarapu} can be deployed as either single-face or dual-face readout by using either an opaque reflector plate (single) or a second dichroic filter window (dual) on the second face.  Figure~\ref{fig:3dtpc-pd} shows how a light-collector module is incorporated into an \dword{apa}. An identical modular mounting scheme was used for each of the options investigated. One module spans the width of an \dword{apa}.

%\{It would be good to have a figure here - Dave can you make one like fig. 1.2 that has x-arapucas?}
%\{Dave W:  I will make a new version of this figure showing \dword{xarapu}s in time for the second draft.}

%This section summarizes all aspects of the design and implementation of \dword{pds} in the \spmod. %10kt far detector single phase detector system.

The \dword{xarapu}, adopted for the baseline design, is an evolution of the ARAPUCA concept that further improves the collection efficiency, while retaining the same working principle, mechanical form factor and active photosensitive coverage. 
 In the original ARAPUCA concept, two wavelength shifters were coated on either side of the dichroic filter window. 
Figure~\ref{fig:pds-x-arapuca-cell} illustrates a single \dword{xarapu} small cell design, used for prototypes, with the wavelength-shifter doped polyvinyl toluene (PVT)  light guide\footnote{Eljen EJ-286\texttrademark{}.} (labeled ``\dword{wls} plate'' in the figure) occupies a portion of the cell volume between the dichroic filter windows, replacing the inner surface coating. 

Photons entering the plate are 
wavelength-shifted with high efficiency and some fraction (those incident on the plate surface at greater than the critical angle) are transported to the readout via total internal reflection. Those exiting the plate reflect off the filter or highly reflecting other surfaces of the cell with some fraction eventually incident on a \dword{sipm}, as in a standard ARAPUCA cell.
\dword{xarapu} is thus effectively a hybrid solution between the \dword{sarapu} and the wavelength-shifting light guide concepts implemented in \dword{pdsp}.

%\fixme{\color{blue}Dave: A Google search for Eljen EJ-296 identifies it (on the Eljen site) as a scintillator paint - is there a reference for the doped plate (and the plate material)? }

%\fixme{DWW:  Yes--  should be EJ-286, which chows up on their page as WLS plate.  Fixed in footnote}

This solution minimizes the number of reflections on the internal surfaces of the cell and thus the probability of photon loss. Simulations suggest that this modification will lead to a significant increase of the collection efficiency, to approximately 60\%, allowing the photon detection efficiency -- including the \dword{sipm} response -- to approach 20\% in principle.  Results from prototype measurements are presented in Sections~\ref{sec:xarapuca-unicamp} and \ref{sec:iceberg-teststand}.

%In the \dword{xarapu} design, Figure~\ref{fig:pds-x-arapuca-cell}, the inner shifter coating/lining over the reflective walls of the box is replaced by a thin wavelength-shifting light guide slab inside the box, of the same dimensions of the acceptance filter window and parallel to it. The \dword{sipm} arrays are installed vertically on the sides of the box, parallel to the light guide thin ends.

% \fixme{Anne proposes to remove: This thin wavelength-shifting slab replaces the inner shifter coating over the reflective walls in the \dword{pdsp} \dword{sarapu} design. }
This design is easily configurable to detect light from just one side, as required for the side \dword{apa}s, or from both sides for the central \dword{apa}s.

a  reflector.  In both cases, the \dword{sipm} arrays are installed on two of the narrow sides of the cell perpendicular to the windows, parallel to and up against the light guide thin ends. Half of the \dword{sipm} active detection area collects photons from the light guide, a quarter of the area on either side of the guide is free to collect the fraction of photons reflected off the cell walls and windows.

The basic mechanical design of the \dword{xarapu}-based \dword{pd} modules  
is similar to that of the two prototypes produced for \dword{pdsp}. Modifications to the prototype design include:  mechanical changes to allow for single-sided or dual-sided readout; increase in light collection area made possible by larger slots in the \dword{apa}; and modifications to the cabling and connector plan required to move the \dword{pd} cables out of the \dword{apa} side tubes, while reducing the cable requirements to one cat-6 cable per \dword{pd} module.

An \dword{xarapu} module is shaped like a bar with external dimensions of \SI{209.2}{cm} $\times$ \SI{11.8}{cm} $\times$ \SI{2.3}{cm},  allowing insertion between the wire planes through each of the ten slots in an \dword{apa}. 
The module contains four \dword{xarapu} supercells, each with six dichroic filter-based optical windows (for the single-sided readout) or 12 windows (double-sided readout) with an area of \SI{7.8}{cm} $\times$ \SI{9.3}{cm}.  The internal dimensions of  a supercell are approximately \SI{48.8}{cm} $\times$ \SI{10.0}{cm} $\times$ \SI{0.8}{cm}. A \dword{wls} plate (Eljen EJ-286) of dimensions \SI{48.7}{cm} $\times$ \SI{93.0}{cm}$\times$ \SI{0.35}{cm} is centered in the supercell midway between the dichroic windows.  

\begin{dunefigure}[Exploded \dword{xarapu} supercell.]{fig:pds-x-arapuca-exploded-Detail}

\end{dunefigure}

To reduce production costs and simplify fabrication, most of the \dword{pd} components are designed to be water-jet cut from sheets of FR-4 G-10 material, with minimal post-cutting machining required (mostly the tapping of pre-cut holes).  The current design contains many small fasteners; we will investigate replacing some of the fasteners with epoxy lamination of cut sheets where appropriate and cost effective, as the design process matures.

The \dwords{sipm} are mounted to PCBs called "Photosensor mounting boards", which are positioned on the long sides of the supercell.  
Six \dwords{sipm} are mounted to a single photosensor mounting board.  All six are electrically connected in parallel (``Passively ganged'').

%\fixme{Clarify PCBs vs photosensor mounting board vs passive photosensor ganging (in figure). Anne}
%\fixme{Addressed 1-14-19.  DWW}

 Before mounting into the \dword{xarapu} module the boards are tested at room and LN2 temperatures. It is anticipated that production of the boards for the \dwords{spmod} will be done outside the USA, and South American institutions will optimize the design.
 %\{latin am or south - pick one} 
 Each supercell uses eight photosensor mounting boards, each with six \dwords{sipm} (Fig.~\ref{fig:mounting-board-routing-board}(top)), %mounting boards are used per supercell 
 to accommodate the 48 \dwords{sipm}.  The ganged signal outputs from these boards are connected to traces in signal routing boards at the edge of the \dword{pd} module. These signal routing boards also act as mechanical elements in the design, mechanically joining the supercells and providing for rigidity.  These PCBs are four-layer boards, approximately \SI{104.6}{cm} $\times$ \SI{2.3}{cm} $\times$ \SI{0.15}{cm}.

The passively ganged signals are then routed through these boards to an active-ganging PCB at the center of the module, where all eight passively ganged signals from a single supercell are actively ganged into one output channel (Fig.~\ref{fig:mounting-board-routing-board}(bottom)). This summed output from a single supercell is then connected to a single twisted pair in the cat-6 readout cable for the module.  The active ganging PCBs (one per supercell, four per module) are positioned in the module so that they are located inside the central \dword{apa} mechanical support tube when fully installed.

The optical window(s) of each supercell are dichroic filters with cut-off at \SI{400}{nm}. While the filters used for the \dword{pdsp} prototypes have been acquired from Omega Optical Inc.\footnote{http://www.omegafilters.com/}. Opto Eletronica S.A.\footnote{http://www.opto.com.br/} (in Brazil) is our current primary candidate vendor for DUNE production filters . Other vendors are also being considered for the DUNE production\footnote{ASHAI -Japan, Andover-USA, Edmunds Optics-USA}.
% rjw 12/2/18 the following moved to Prod and Assembly
%Prior to coating, the filters are cleaned according to the procedures given by the manufacturer using isopropyl alcohol. Since the most likely vector for scratching/damaging the coating is dragging contaminated wipes across the surface, new clean lint free wipes are used for each  cleaning pass on the surface. Clean filters are then baked at 100$^\circ$C for \SI{12}{hours}.    
   
The filters are coated on the external side facing the \lar active volume with \dword{ptp}\footnote{p-TerPhenyl, supplier: Sigma-Aldrich\textregistered.}.  The coatings for the \dword{pdsp} modules have been made at the thin film facility facility at Fermilab using a vacuum evaporator. Each coated filter was dipped in LN2 to check the stability of the evaporated coating at cryogenic temperature. 

\forlbnc{line 9 - is the plan to do all coatings at Fermilab? }

For the \dword{fd}, filter coatings will be done by the vacuum deposition facility at UNICAMP (see \ref{sec:xarapuca-unicamp})

%For \dword{pdsp} \dword{pd} production the evaporation process will be performed at Unicamp in Brazil, where a large vacuum evaporator with an internal diameter of one meter is now available. The  conversion efficiency of the film deposited on the filters or on the Vikuiti\texttrademark\ foils will be measured with a dedicated set-up that will use the \SI{127}{nm} light produced by a VUV monochromator.

%\fixme{rjw 1/13/19 The following moved from what was originally a design considerations section...but converted by Anne to an overview, so this was too much detail. Moved the summary that was here in the Design section to there. Need to condense to a shorter narrative and get to the bottom line.} 

%The \dword{spmod} \dword{pds} uses a multi-step approach to scintillation light detection with the final stage of conversion into electrical charge performed by silicon photomultipliers (\dwords{sipm}). Robust photon detection efficiency, low operating voltages, small size and ruggedness make their use attractive in the \single design where the photon detectors must fit inside the \dword{apa} frames. 

The physics goals,  design of the light collectors, and the trigger and data acquisition system determine the suite of \dword{sipm} specifications (e.g., number of devices, spectral sensitivity, dynamic range, triggering, zero-suppression threshold) for the silicon photosensors. An initial survey of commercial products and a 12-month period of R\&D indicated that the performance characteristics of devices from several vendors effectively meet the \dword{pds} needs. 
However, a key requirement is to ensure the mechanical and electrical integrity of these devices in a cryogenic environment. Catalog devices for most vendors are certified for operation only down to \num{-40}$^\circ$C and though one candidate device performed well initially, after an unadvertised production process change a large fraction cracked when submerged in \dword{lar}\footnote{SensL MicroFC-60035C-SMT}. This highlighted the need to be in close communication with vendors in the 
\dword{sipm} design, fabrication and packaging certification stages to ensure 
robust and reliable long-term operation in a cryogenic environment. 

Nearly one thousand of several types of \dwords{sipm} are used in the \dword{pdsp} \dword{pd}\footnote{\dword{pdsp} \dword{pds} uses 516 SensL MicroFC-60035C-SMT, 288 Hamamatsu MPPC 13360-6050CQ-SMD with cryogenic packaging, 180 Hamamatsu MPPC 13360-6050VE.}, providing an excellent test bed for evaluation and monitoring of \dword{sipm} performance in a realistic environment over a period of months. Results from \dword{pdsp} are summarized in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-validation}.

Two entities have expressed interest to engage with the consortium with an explicit intent to provide a product specifically for cryogenic operation: (1) Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., a large well-known commercial vendor in Japan, and (2) Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) in Italy. FBK is an experienced developer of solid state photosensors that typically licenses its technology; it is partnering with the DarkSide collaboration to develop devices with specifications very similar to DUNE's.  Table~\ref{tab:photosensors} summarizes the key characteristics of the baseline device, Hamamatsu S13360, and two other devices from Hamamatsu and FBK under consideration.

\forlbnc{1-26 Table 1,5 I am concerned by the approach to photosensors. It could lead to an interminable R\&D program. There needs to be a Clear Plan and Clear criteria for convergence to a choice in a very finite time.}

\fixme{Photosensor working group--  can you add some text about the downselect process here}

\fixme{\color{blue} Francesco: Can we show some performance info from  FBK devices here?}


As described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-lc}, the size and sensitivity of currently available \dwords{sipm} requires that multiple devices are needed for each \dword{xarapu} cell. The spatial granularity of each device is much smaller than required for DUNE so,
along with limitations on the number of readout channels, it is required that the signal output of the \dwords{sipm} must be electrically ganged. The terminal capacitance of the sensors strongly affects the \dword{s/n} when devices are ganged in parallel, which led to a design that passively gangs several sets of \dwords{sipm} in parallel, which are then summed with active components, as described in Section~\ref{sec:pds-design-ganging}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%rjw 12/1/18 the following moved from the Design section
%The following summarizes the most salient guiding principles and requirements for this \dword{sipm}-based photodetection system.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item  The physics goals and the photon collection implementation determine the full suite of \dword{sipm} specifications (e.g., number of devices, spectral sensitivity, dynamic range, triggering, zero-suppression threshold).  As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-intro},  the requirements for \dword{snb} neutrinos are not yet fully established, however R\&D carried out to date indicates that performance characteristics of devices from several vendors are close to meeting the %that needed for the \dword{pds} needs (see Table~\ref{tab:photosensors}). 
%Nearly one thousand of several types of these devices are used in the \dword{pdsp} \dword{pd}\footnote{\dword{pdsp} \dword{pds} uses 516 sensL MicroFC-60035C-SMT, 288 Hamamatsu MPPC 13360-6050CQ-SMD with cryogenic packaging, 180 Hamamatsu MPPC 13360-6050VE.}, providing an excellent test bed for evaluation and monitoring of \dword{sipm} performance in a realistic environment over a period of months. Results from this are summarized in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-validation}.
%\item A key requirement is to ensure the mechanical and electrical integrity of these devices in a cryogenic environment.
%Currently, catalog devices for most vendors are certified for operation only down to \num{-40}$^\circ$C. It is essential to be in close communication with  vendors in the
%\dword{sipm} design, fabrication and packaging certification stages to ensure robust and reliable long-term operation in a cryogenic environment. 
%Two vendors have expressed interest to engage with the consortium in this fashion with the goal of %having the vendor warranty  providing a warranty of the product for our application: Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., a large well-known commercial vendor in Japan and Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) in Italy. FBK is an experienced developer of solid state photosensors that typically licenses its technology;  it is partnering with the DarkSide collaboration to develop devices with specifications very similar to DUNE's. 
%Contact with other vendors and experiments using this technology in a similar environment is also being pursued. 
%\item DUNE must carry out comparative performance evaluation of promising \dword{sipm} candidates from multiple vendors in parallel over the next year. This evaluation will  address inherent device characteristics (e.g., gain, dark rate, x-talk, after-pulsing) that are common to all three options, along with ganging performance, form factor, spectral response, and mechanical mounting options that may have different optimizations for the two light guide designs and ARAPUCA. Experience acquired from \dword{pdsp} construction and operation will inform QA/QC plans for the full detector.
%\fix{which will need to be delineated in detail. -Anne removed -let's reference where this is done}
%\fix{Also: the above does not strike me as a principle or a requirement/spec. It is  to-do item. Anne}
%\item Size constraints and other considerations imply that the signal output of \dwords{sipm} must be electrically ganged.  The area of current candidate \dwords{sipm} is less than \SI{1}{cm$^2$}, providing a much finer granularity than needed. In addition, the cold feedthrough size and space in the \dword{apa}s for cable runs limits the number of \dword{pd} signal and power cables.  The degree of ganging depends on the number of individual \dwords{sipm} needed to achieve the required light yield. For the \dword{xarapu} this is expected to be in the range of \num{12} to \num{48} \dwords{sipm} per channel.  Simple passive-ganging (wiring the outputs together) and active-ganging (with active components) have been investigated.
%\item The terminal capacitance of the sensors strongly affects the \dword{s/n} when devices are ganged in parallel and thus is a factor in \dword{sipm} selection. It may ultimately determine the maximum number of individual sensors that can be ganged this way.

The baseline \dword{pds} design has 192 \num{6}$\times$\SI{6}{mm$^2$} \dwords{mppc} per \dword{pd} module with groups of 48 \dwords{mppc} electrically ganged into four electronics readout channels. This leads to a total of 288,000 \dwords{mppc} per \dword{spmod}. 
%The ganging (signal-summing) scheme is described in the next section.

%XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
%XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX


%As implemented in \dword{pdsp}, there are twelve \num{6}$\times$\SI{6}{mm$^2$} \dwords{sipm} per bar and \numrange{6}{12} per ARAPUCA box.
%With this configuration, a \nominalmodsize \dword{spmod} with \num{150} \dwords{apa}, each with \num{10} \dword{pd} modules, would contain \num{18000}-\num{36000} (single or double-ended readout) \dwords{sipm} for the light guide designs and 10-20 times more for the higher granularity ARAPUCA design. This corresponds to approximately \num{1}-\SI{13}{m$^2$} of active \dword{sipm} surface area.

The electronic readout system for the PDS must (1) collect and process electrical signals from \dword{sipm}s reading out the light collected by the \dwords{xarapu}, (2) provide an interface with the trigger and timing systems supporting data reduction and classification, and (3) transfer data to offline storage for physics analysis. Figure~\ref{fig:pds-electronics_cartoon} provides a simple overview of the basic elements.

As specified in Table~\ref{tab:specs:SP-PDS}, the readout system must enable the $t_0$ measurement of non-beam events; this capability will also enhance beam physics by recording interaction time of events within

%\{other prototypes?} -- no
as described in Section~\ref{sec:ssp-protodune-electronics}. However, a more cost-effective wave form digitization system developed for the Mu2e experiment has been identified and selected as the baseline choice. %rjw 4/19 It is very likely that the final system will be a hybrid of \dword{pdsp} SSP and Mu2e readout concepts.


%Physics simulation studies are currently underway to determine if pulse-shape discrimination will be required, which would provide the capability to record both prompt and delayed components of scintillation light (characteristic times of \SI{6}{ns} and \SI{1.3}{$\mu$s}), the latter consisting mostly of single photoelectrons and thus place stringent requirements on \dword{s/n} performance. 
% *** 12/3/18 Per Josh S  - the mu2e system can do this so can use for this purpose. No need to reference the studies.

This section describes the scheme used to electrically gang the signals from 48 \dwords{sipm} and the baseline \dword{fe} electronics system.


%Selection of the ganging option will include passive or active solutions, where the active 
%circuitry may require cold components such as an amplifier in the \lar volume. Design options with active cold components will need 
%to address issues of power dissipation and potential risks of single-point failures of multi-channel devices inside the cryostat.
%In the case of passive ganging, analog signals are transmitted outside of the cryostat for processing and digitalization. 
%Successful demonstrations of passive ganging at \lar temperatures have been made for groups of four and twelve 6x6 mm Micro-FC-60035C-SMT C series, and groups of 2, 4, 8, and 12  Hamamatsu \dwords{mppc} (S13360-6050PE) at  \num{25}$^\circ$C, - \num{70}$^\circ$C and \SI{77}{K}. 
%Active ganging has been demonstrated for an array of 12 sensL \num{4}$\times$\num{4} arrays of \SI{3}{mm}$\times$\SI{3}{mm} sensL C-series \dwords{sipm} (48 in all) and  72 \dwords{sipm} mounted in a hybrid combination of passive and active ganging using \SI{6}{mm}$\times$\SI{6}{mm} \dwords{mppc} with a low noise operational amplifier--this design combines 12 active branches into the op-amp, where each branch has six \dwords{mppc} in a parallel passive-ganging configuration.

\subsection{SiPM Signal Ganging}
\label{sec:pds-design-ganging}
%{Zelimir added this subsection}

Light collector techniques require electrical summing (ganging) of the \dwords{sipm} in order to maximize the active area of the photosensors while keeping the channel count reasonably low. The ganging of electrical signals from \dword{sipm} arrays is implemented to minimize the electronics channel count while maintaining adequate redundancy and granularity, as well as to improve the readout system performance.  
Technical factors that affect performance of the ganging system are the characteristic capacitance of the \dword{sipm} and the number of \dwords{sipm} connected together, which together dictate the \dword{s/n} and affect the system performance and design considerations.

We have demonstrated a feasible purely passive summing scheme with twelve Hamamatsu \dword{mppc} sensors now operational in \dword{pdsp}. For optimal performance in DUNE, we have shown that an ensemble of 48 Hamamatsu \SI{6}{mm}$\times$\SI{6}{mm} \dwords{mppc} can be summed into a single channel by a combination of passive and active ganging (see Section~\ref{sec:pds-valid-ganging}).  In this scheme, an amplifier is used to adjust the \dword{mppc} output signal level to the input of an \dword{adc}; the active summing is realized with an OpAmp THS4131. This combination of passive and active ganging with cold signal summing and amplification, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:fig-pds-6x8gang}, is the baseline for the \dword{pds}.

In addition to the baseline scheme, a parallel effort is underway to investigate further optimization including development of detailed simulation and testing of prototype boards in South America. One scheme being investigated simulates the signals of 12 passively ganged \dwords{sipm} passed through a charge integrator or a charge amplifier transimpedance model into a summing stage. The simulation flow and the simulated response are shown in

The development framework presented above presents a very powerful tool in the design of the electronics. It shows that is possible to gang 48 \dwords{sipm} and distinguish single photon signals with less than 1 $\mu$s width.
%.For single photons there is no significant difference between both models in duration of the pulse and S/N ratio. Preliminary simulations indicates that for 10 photons we don’t see any difference either.
The \dword{s/n} ratio obtained is about \SI{8}{dB}, with all noise effects, including thermal and dark noise contributions.

%\{add more in validation section?}
%5.The optimal sampling rate obtained is >≈ 20 MSPS.
%6.The design of the board for the ICEBERG test stand is ready and in process of fabrication. It includes both designs in the same board, that can be easily exchanged.

%This solution is now used as the baseline summing option for DUNE Far Detector.
%next steps?:This board will also measure the photoelectron collection efficiency when the \dwords{sipm} are coated with \dword{tpb} as a reference for ARAPUCA measurements with a similar ganging level (the summing  board is the same size as the \dword{pdsp} ARAPUCA backplane to facilitate the comparisons). 

%Charge processing requires a charge preamplifier ideally located within the cold environment, so the design must take into consideration the failure risks and the power dissipated into the environment.

%{rjw 11/23/2018: Here should be a description of the Gustavo's and Paraguay groups ganging scheme options (results are in the validation section) - can we identify the FNAL scheme as baseline for the purpose of the TDR draft? Perhaps in the section add the circuit design and drawing of the ganging circuit board that could go in a 10kt production module.}
%{Zelimir added ganging from Gustavo, and from Jorge base on Jorge's 30\% review slides.}

%Typically, arrival time and total charge are the key parameters to be obtained from a detector. Extraction of these parameters 
%is possible using analog or digital systems. Charge preamplifiers will be connected to the output of the detector to integrate current producing a charge proportional output. 

% => this to next steps: In both systems, performance parameters related  to sampling rate, number of bits, power requirements, signal to noise ratio, and interface requirements should be evaluated to arrive to selected solution.  
%Pulse shapes can be fully analyzed to improve detection of a new physics but it will have an important impact on the digitalization frequency.

\subsection{Front-end Electronics Baseline Design}
\label{sec:electronics}
%\{11/28/18  Josh S. text/figures on Mu2e}

Following the successful design, fabrication, operation and performance of \dfirst{ssp} readout in \dword{pdsp}, and with initial high-quality beam and cosmic ray day data collected by the \dword{pdsp} photon system, we are
further cost-optimizing the readout electronics.  To this end we have adopted a lower-cost solution based on lower sampling rate commercial ultrasound ASIC chips rather than digitizers based on flash \dwords{adc}. Inspiration for this cost-effective front-end comes from the system developed for the Mu2e experiment cosmic ray tagger readout system.
Both systems are currently used in the photon detector validation process summarized in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-validation} to allow direct comparison.

\forlbnc{Section 1.5.2.1 - lots of development work needed - who is doing this? Fermilab? Is this tested (the mu2e system?)}

Development of the readout electronics has been led by US groups, including Argonne National Labs (SSP development, demonstrating the concept of wave-form digitization of \dword{sipm} signals over approximately 30m cable lengths with single-PE resolution), and a collaboration of Fermilab and the University of Michigan (demonstrating a low-cost modification to this readout plan, using low-cost commercial ADCs and FPGAs).  Development efforts to date have included the 35T \dword{pdsp} (for the SSP system) and \dword{iceberg} (for the mu2e-based readout system).  Since fabrication of the readout electronics will be conducted by a collaboration of Latin American institutions, including groups in Peru, Colombia, Paraguay and Brazil (with support from US groups in an advisory roll), further development of this system will involve a collaboration of all these groups.  Engineers from several of these groups will meet at Fermilab in the summer of 2019 to continue the development of the system, with testing focused at the \dword{iceberg} test facility.  Final pre-production mu2e-based electronics readout will also be tested in the ProtoDUNE-II run at \dword{cern} in 2021-2022.

\subsubsection{Front-end Board and Controller}

The readout and digitization of the signals from the active summing board described in Section~\ref{sec:pds-design-ganging} will rely on a set of front-end board (\dword{feb}) readout electronics boards and controller boards, originally designed for the Mu2e experiment~\cite{bib:mu2e_tdr}
at Fermilab. As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:pds-valid-ganging}, preliminary results indicate that the active-summing board and Mu2e electronics \dword{feb} combination will perform well together and, in general, meet the readout requirements for the experiment. The 64~channel \dword{feb} design carried over from Mu2e can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:feb}. The board has a number of notable features, discussed below. Most importantly, %however, 
the board is designed to utilize commercial, off-the-shelf parts only, and is therefore quite inexpensive compared to other designs. In particular, for the digitization it uses the low-noise, high-gain, and high-dynamic-range commercial \dwords{adc} used in ultrasonic transducers. 

The \dword{feb} is the centerpiece of the baseline readout electronics system.  
The current 64~channel\footnote{This text assumes 64 channels/\dword{feb} when presenting the \dword{feb} and controller. However, we envision 40~channels/\dword{feb} in the final design, corresponding to a single \dword{apa} as described in the ``Next Steps" section.} \dword{feb} relies on commercial ultrasound chips\footnote{Texas Instruments\texttrademark{} 12~bit, 80~MS/s; AFE5807.},
%fixme{check if "next steps" section still there after rearrangement}  
with programmable anti-alias filters and gain stages, to read out the \dword{mppc} signals from the active ganging boards inside the \dword{pd} modules. The board currently takes HDMI inputs, with four channels per input.  Each of the eight ultrasound chips on an \dword{feb} handles eight channels (\SI{120}{mW} per channel) of data using a low-noise preamplifier, a programmable gain amplifier, and a programmable low-pass filter. The information is buffered with a total of \SI{1}{GB} DDR SDRAM, divided in four places, and a set of Spartan~6\texttrademark \dwords{fpga} are used for parallelizing the serial \dword{adc} data, zero suppression, and timing. Each of the four \dwords{fpga} on a board, corresponding to 16 channels, handles two \dword{adc} chips with an available \SI{256}{MB} DDR SDRAM. 

After digitization, the data from each \dword{feb}, in the form of pulses (time-stamp and pulse height) is sent to a master controller via Ethernet, which aggregates the signals from 24 \dword{feb}s, or $64 \times 24=1536$ channels. The 24 \dword{feb}s corresponding to a single controller will come in sets of 12, with each set of 12 \dword{feb}s referenced to a single chassis as shown in %. A picture and schematic of the controller is seen in 
Figure~\ref{fig:controller}. A trigger decision (e.g., accelerator timing signal) can be produced and/or received by the controller and, depending on the decision, each event's digital information is sent to the controller and then to \dword{daq} computers for processing and storage. The controller-to-\dword{daq} connection will rely on a fiber connection, although an Ethernet-based controller output option is available.

% {Since we cannot use this feature (next paragraph) is it worth mentioning? would it need to be removed by the redesigned \dword{feb}? Is that step scheduled?} - remove the follow para

% In addition to its digitization and decision-making abilities, the current \dword{feb} has a number of other notable features. For example, each \dword{feb} contains an onboard Cockcroft-Walton (CW), which is available to generate bias voltage for the \dwords{mppc}. Notably, however, the CW is not currently considered an option for the summing board as it isn't stable enough to bias the differential amplifier. The CW is capable of providing $\approx$+75 V of bias. The board can also apply $\approx$-3~V to the \dword{mppc} anode, allowing the possibility of 78~V. In addition to the \dword{mppc} bias, the \dword{feb}s allow for an on-board current measurement (\SI{100}{pA} resolution) for producing IV curves of \dwords{mppc}. The \dword{feb}s can also be used in stand-alone mode, without a controller, via a telnet interface, which is useful for R\&D purposes and debugging. 
 
\subsubsection{Bandwidth, readout rates, and zero suppression}

\dword{daq} system and data storage limitations impose constraints on the  data flow from the front-end electronics system. 
For example, if it were necessary to read out a \SI{5.5}{\micro\second} waveform (which represents the longest reasonable waveform) 
%is 5.5 mus based on simulation? What happens with overlaping waveforms where longer readout is required, plus calibration etc?
in order to include late-light, the \SI{80}{MS/s}, 12 bit \dword{adc} device would produce a 5.3~kbit waveform. For an envisioned dark count (DC) rate of 250~Hz/channel, this corresponds to a data transfer rate of 53~Mbps/\dword{apa} (1~\dword{apa}=40 channels) or 6.6~MB/s \dword{feb}-to-controller DC rate. This rate approaches the crucial bottleneck in the electronics readout system with a maximum rate of 10~MB/s  %\dword{feb}-to-controller rate 
(per \dword{feb}). However, zero-suppression techniques and multi-channel coincidence/threshold requirements at the \dword{feb} firmware level can be used to significantly mitigate this issue, noting that each on-\dword{feb} \dword{fpga} handles 16 channels. 

It will be necessary to fully understand the system requirements such as the suppression factor in terms of parameters like the readout window length and overall trigger rate to guide the final design. 
Firmware and zero-suppression technique development is in progress and will be informed by the physics and calibration requirements of the \dword{pd}. 
In addition to its bandwidth and DC rate readout capabilities, the system can also  manage a highly-coincident event in which a large number (or all) channels fire at once. For example, a ``maximum (unrealistic)" all-detector event featuring 6000~channels firing at once (corresponding to 4~MB) could be handled by the controller's 24-board write speed of 150~MB/s. 

The baseline electronics readout system performance is consistent with the \dword{daq} interface specification of 8~Gbps per connection, given that  
each \dword{feb} signal corresponds to a maximum of 10~Mbps (240~Mbps total).  

\fixme{AIH?: (previous sentence) LBNC It seems that the PDS has a lot more knowledge of the DAQ specifications than I recall from the DAQ TDR!}

\forlbnc{8 Gbps/APA was the data rate limit we were given in conversation with the DAQ. We cannot speak to this specification being missing from the DAQ TDR.}

\subsubsection{Power, grounding, and rack schemes} 

Figure~\ref{fig:grounding_power} shows the grounding, power, and data link schemes for the system. The \dword{feb}s are powered via power-over-Ethernet (600 mA, 48 V supply) from the controller. One Cat-6 cable from the controller to each \dword{feb} handles the signal and power simultaneously. The reference planes of the controller and \dword{feb} are isolated on both sides. The grounding scheme calls for each set of 12 \dword{feb}s referenced to a single chassis, with each chassis and corresponding controller on detector ground and the \dword{daq}, connected to each controller via fiber, on building ground. 
 
The rack space and power consumption required by the system assume
a total of 6000 channels with 40 channels/\dword{feb}. This system requires 13 chassis (12 \dword{feb}/chassis) at 6u each and seven controllers (controlling 24 \dword{feb} each) at 1u each. Assuming 42u per rack and with this requirement of $\approx$85u, just over  two racks are needed. The power supply on a controller is 700~W, with each \dword{feb} taking 20~W.

\subsection{Electronics Next Steps}

%{Zelimir moved sections around 11/29/2018, and also made a pass through the text below.}
%{updated by Toups 11/28/2018}

%Toups start - 11/28/2018
Although the \dword{feb}s developed for the Mu2e cosmic ray veto and proposed here for use in DUNE have %been 
demonstrated the capacity to read out an array of \dwords{mppc} with an adequate \dword{s/n} ratio to provide sensitivity to single photons, there are a number of optimization and development tasks that are being pursued:  
\begin{enumerate}
\item The warm readout electronics presented here assume that only 48 out of the 64 channels on the Mu2e \dword{feb} are populated to better match the 40 ProtoDUNE channels per \dword{apa}.  A prototype board will %be produced to 
test this configuration and validate the associated cost model.  
\item The Mu2e warm readout electronics use last-generation (Xilinx\texttrademark{} Spartan-6) \dwords{fpga} and other components that have since been superceded by newer devices.  Design and prototyping work will %be done to 
incorporate newer \dwords{fpga} (Xilinx Spartan-7 or Artix-7) into the electronics, %which will 
improving their performance and maintainability over the lifetime of the DUNE experiment. The Artix-7 \dwords{fpga} have been implemented with \dword{ssp} readout system used in \dword{pdsp} and therefore the expertise with these system components has been established. 
\item Results from the ICEBERG test stand can determine whether there are sufficient logic resources in the \dwords{fpga} to meet a broad range of possible \dword{daq} requirements expected from the warm readout electronics. To that end the low-cost front-end solution will be compared to existing 14-bit, 150 MS/s \dword{ssp} readout. At present, straightforward zero suppression schemes that can be implemented on the Mu2e board with the current Spartan-6 \dword{fpga} will be tested with respect to potential \dword{daq} data rate limitations.  However, increases in the number of logic cells can be accommodated by switching to more capable but still pinout-compatible devices within the same Xilinx \dword{fpga} family as discussed above.  
\item It may be desirable to increase the dynamic range of the \dwords{adc} used on the \dword{feb}s in order to achieve desired physics goals related to the energy resolution of beam neutrino events.  To this end, %work should be done 
we plan to investigate replacing the TI AFE5807 ultrasound chip with the TI AFE5808 ultrasound chip, which is pinout-compatible but incorporates a 14-bit \dword{adc}.  Ultimately, a prototype board will %need to be built 
incorporate all of the optimizations and improvements listed above.

%Although the requirements for the electronics system are not all fully established, it not expected that the system requires novel high-risk techniques and can be developed and fabricated well within the schedule for the \dword{pds}.
The final requirements for the system will be informed by analysis of the data from the readout system implemented in \dword{pdsp} and subsequently data from ICEBERG expected in spring 2019.

\forlbnc{pg 1-33 - line 30 - when are decisions needed on this?}

Specifications for the readout electronics system will be determined before the CD2/3 review (See the high-level schedule section, \ref{sec:fdsp-pd-org-cs}).  Additional testing of the system will continue through ProtoDUNE II operations, and the specifications re-considered in light of that operation for the pre-production review prior to beginning final readout electronics production, as shown in the high-level schedule.

%As identified in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-ps}, the most important near term R\&D program will be to optimize the ganging scheme including choice of \dword{sipm} and cable types. 
%The first objective is to demonstrate that an ensemble of \numrange{48}{72} Hamamatsu \SI{6}{mm}$\times$\SI{6}{mm} \dwords{mppc} can be summed into a single channel by a combination of passive and active ganging. This board will also measure the photoelectron collection efficiency when the \dwords{sipm} are coated with \dword{tpb} as a reference for ARAPUCA measurements with a similar ganging level (the summing  board is the same size as the \dword{pdsp} ARAPUCA backplane to facilitate the comparisons).
%Charge processing requires a charge preamplifier ideally located within the cold environment, so the design must take into consideration the failure risks and the power dissipated into the environment.

%The timing resolution, minimum threshold and dynamic range requirements for the system are dictated by the physics requirements. These are well known for the higher energy physics (>\SI{200}{MeV}) but, as noted elsewhere in this document, are still evolving for lower energy. Currently,  a timing resolution of 1$\mu$s is called for and the sampling rate and number of sample bits is estimated based on this. For this task some digital process such as a sample interpolation may be proposed, enhancing the recorded raw sample time precision.
%The light sensitivity and the dynamic range requirement will determine the number of bits and the sample rate required by either waveform or charge collection methods. In both cases, the signal to noise ratio and the power consumption must be estimated.  
%With this data from \dword{pdsp} and the ganging studies, the choice between waveform readout and integrated charge readout will be made taking into account \dword{daq} readout and trigger requirements and, in general, the physics requirements of the experiment.

%\subsection{Introduction}

%The \dword{pds} will incorporate a monitoring and calibration that will meet the physics requirements of the DUNE experiment. The pulsed UV-light system described in this section will be used to verify the photon detector gain, linearity, and timing resolution; and to monitor stability and the system response over time.  Figure~\ref{fig:pds_calmon_fig1} shows a cartoon of the placement of the system in the TPC. The system will also be an important detector commissioning tool: before closing the cryostat, in the cool-down phase, and when it is being filled with \lar.

The system hardware consists of both warm and cold components. Diffusers mounted on the \dwords{cpa} panels provide light sources illuminating \dwords{pd} embedded in the \dword{apa}s. These light diffusers uniformly illuminate the \dword{apa} area containing the \dword{pds} light collection modules. %Cold components (diffusers and fibers) interface with \dword{hv} systems design. 
 Diffusers are installed on the \dwords{cpa} and therefore reside at the %same \dword{cpa} 
 \dword{cpa} potential and interface with \dword{hv} system. 
Quartz fibers are insulators used to transport light from optical feedthroughs (at the cryostat top) through \dword{fc} \dword{gp}, and through \dword{fc} strips to the \dword{cpa} top frame. These fibers are then optically connected to diffusers located on the \dword{cpa} panels. 
The \hv system places a requirement on the fiber electrical resistance to 
protect the cathode from shorting out. 
Warm components include controlled pulsed-UV source (\SIrange{245}{280}{nm}) and warm optics. These warm components will interface with
% \fixme{what's CTF?}
\dword{cisc} and \dword{daq} subsystems. The optical feedthrough is a part of the cryostat interface.

\fixme{Bob--  I edited this to include some of what Zelimir sent us.  You might want to shorten it again.}

The system has no active components within the cryostat. The active system component consists of a 1U rack mount Light Calibration Module (\dword{lcm}) sitting outside the cryostat. The \dword{lcm} generates light pulses that propagate through a quartz fiber-optic cable to diffusers at the \dword{cpa} to distribute the light uniformly across the photon detectors mounted within the \dword{apa}. The \dword{lcm} utilizes the logic and timing control developed to meet DUNE \dword{daq} requirements. It consists of an \dword{fpga}-based control logic unit coupled to an internal LED Pulser Module (\dword{lpm}) and an additional bulk power supply. The \dword{lpm} utilizes multiple digital outputs from the control board to control the pulse amplitude, pulse multiplicity, repetition rates, and pulse duration, using \dwords{dac} to control the \dword{lpm} pulse amplitude. \dword{adc} channels internal to the \dword{lcm} are used to read out a reference photodiode used for pulse-by-pulse monitoring of the \dword{led} light output. The output of the monitoring diode is available for normalizing the response of the \dwords{sipm} in the detector to the monitoring pulse. 

Hardware components for the \dword{dune} detectors have been designed and costed based on expertise gained with \dword{pdsp} prototype detector, as described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-validation-candm}.
