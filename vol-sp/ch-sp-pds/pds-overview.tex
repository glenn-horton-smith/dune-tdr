The DUNE \dword{fd} consists of detector systems for charge and light produced by an ionization event in the \lartpc.  The charge detection system permits both calorimetry and position determination, with two of the three spatial coordinates ($y$ and $z$)  established by the position of the \dword{apa} wires receiving the charge and the third ($x$) by the arrival time of the charge.  Locating the $x$ position requires an independent determination of the time of the ionization event, a clock start time.  Two systems provide this in DUNE:  the Fermilab accelerator system for neutrino beam related events and the \dword{pds}.  

Neutrino \dword{cpv} and other elements of the DUNE long-baseline neutrino program do not rely, to first order, on the \dword{pds}.  The neutrino beam timing allows full functionality of the \dword{apa}s, and the deep underground location reduces the possibility of in-time background events from cosmic rays and other sources to a negligible level.  
Similarly, DUNE can detect \dwords{snb} originating within the galaxy without a \dword{pds}.  In this case, the presence of thousands of even very low energy (\SI{5}-\SI{30}{MeV}) events, consisting of tracks only a few millimeters long, occurring over tens of seconds would provide an unambiguous signal that the TPC could characterize on its own.
By contrast, DUNE's nucleon decay physics could not be executed without the \dword{pds}.  The inability to establish a clock start time would make it impossible to determine whether a candidate proton decay event was fully contained in the detector volume or associated with objects entering the detector from the outside.  

While only absolutely required for proton decay searches, the \dword{pds} directly enhances physics capabilities for all three DUNE physics drivers, opens up prospects for further physics explorations, and contributes to a more robust set of operating points of the detector that help all physics.   For beam neutrino physics, for example, the \dword{pds} improves the ability to pick up the relatively late time Michel electron produced from the decay of a stopped muon.  In addition to providing a useful calibration source for low energy electrons,  this aids an in situ statistical determination of the antineutrino content of the beam. While 75\% of $\mu^-$ are captured by the nucleus before they decay, all $\mu^+$ produce a Michel electron.  Michel electron tagging assists in background suppression for similar reasons in proton decay searches.  The $p\rightarrow K^+\nu$ mode produces a distinct $K^+\rightarrow\mu^+\rightarrow e^+$ topology.  Picking up the Michel electron at the end of the sequence can help suppress topologically and calorimetrically similar signals from atmospheric neutrino induced $\mu^- p$ final states.  

For \dword{snb} neutrino events, the \dword{pds} allows for proper location of the event vertex and the implementation of position-dependent corrections for charge loss due to electron capture and other transport effects in the TPC, leading to improved energy resolution and possibly greater sensitivity to underlying supernova dynamical models.  The \dword{pds} could open new areas of investigation.  The few-MeV scale solar neutrino interactions occur as isolated events in time and space.  Suppression of radiological and noise related backgrounds to pull out a signal for these events likely requires  redundant measurements with charge and light.  In the event that the DUNE TPC could not operate at its goal electric field of \SI{500}{V/cm}, the \dword{pds} can compensate for lessened charge detector performance:  Light production increases relative to that of free charge for lower \efield{}, and calorimetry using this light production offers a chance of maintaining the overall resolution of the detector. For \dword{snb} physics, the \dword{pds} enables a triggering scheme that greatly assists the \dword{daq} system in maintaining minimal dead time.
 
%The remaining sections further develop the specification and design of a \dword{pds} that supports DUNE physics.

The Physics TDR (Vol.~2) describes the detailed physics simulations of the main DUNE physics drivers.  In the following section we describe additional simulations performed to establish the \dword{pds} performance specifications that are met or exceeded by the design described in the rest of this chapter.
 


% Anne took this part out 12/27: The \dword{pds} is an essential detector subsystem of a DUNE \dword{spmod}. The detection of the prompt scintillation light signal, emitted in coincidence with an ionizing event inside the active volume, allows the determination of the time of occurrence of an event of interest with much higher precision than charge collected from ionization in the TPC. This capability is most critical for the primary DUNE science objectives that are uncorrelated with the timing signal from the neutrino source at \fnal, such as proton decay and neutrinos from a \dword{snb}, and for the ancillary science program including measurements of neutrino oscillation phenomena using atmospheric neutrinos. 



% Anne took this part out 12/27: Timing information from the \dword{pd} and TPC systems allows determination of the drift time of the ionizing particles. Knowledge of the drift time provides localization of the event inside the active volume and %provides the ability to enables corrections to the measured charge for effects that depend on the drift path length, purity of \lar, or for specific locations in the detector %if there are due to non-uniformities.  This correction is important for %the reconstruction of the energy deposited by the ionizing event. In addition to allowing optimum track reconstruction, scintillation light measured by the system may also be used as a trigger and for improved calorimetric measurement in combination with charge measurement.

\subsection{Principle of Operation}
%\{moved this up to intro for principle of operation (anne)}
\lar is known to be an abundant scintillator and emits about \SI{40}{photons/keV} when excited  by minimum ionizing particles~\cite{Doke:1990rza} %,
%There are a number of others possible - see email from ES 4/11/18
in the absence of external \efield{}s. In the presence of \efield{}s the yield is reduced due to recombination; for the nominal DUNE \dword{spmod} field of \SI{500}{V/cm} the yield is approximately \SI{24}{photons/keV.}~\cite{PhysRevB.20.3486}. 
% From ES:  "Dynamical behavior of free electrons in the recombination process in liquid argon, krypton, and xenon", S.Kubota, M.Hishida, M.Suzuki, J.Ruan(Gen), Phys. Rev. B20 (1979), 3486 and Ruan(Gen), Jian-zhi, 

\fixme{Ettore? Check slow time constant - 1.3 musec quoted here, Alex reports 1.5 (or 1.6) musec used in the simulation}
As depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:scintAr}, the passage of ionizing radiation in \lar produces excitations and ionization of the argon atoms that ultimately result in the formation of the excited dimer Ar$^*_2$.  
Photon emission proceeds through the de-excitation of the lowest lying singlet and triplet excited states, $^{1}\Sigma$ and 
$^{3}\Sigma$, to the dissociative ground state. The de-excitation from the $^{1}\Sigma$ state is very fast and has a characteristic time of the order of $\tau_{fast}$ $\simeq$ \SI{6}{ns}. The de-excitation from the $^{3}\Sigma$, state is much slower since it is forbidden by the selection rules; it has a characteristic time of $\tau_{slow}$ $\simeq$ \SI{1.3}{$\mu$sec}.   
In both decays, photons are emitted in a \SI{10}{nm} band centered around \SI{127}{nm}, which is in the \dword{vuv} region of the electromagnetic spectrum~\cite{Heindl:2010zz}.
The relative intensity of the  fast %and 
versus the slow component is related to the ionization density of \lar and depends on the ionizing particle: \num{0.3} for electrons, \num{1.3} for alpha particles and \num{3} for neutrons~\cite{PhysRevB.27.5279}. 
% From ES 4/11/18: A. Hitachi et al., Effect of ionization density on the time dependence of luminescence from liquid Ar and Xe, Ph. Rev. B 27 (1983), 5279;
This phenomenon is the basis for the particle discrimination capabilities of \lar exploited by experiments that have the capacity to separate the two components, but its utility is effectively restricted to events with single charged particles. This %would 
limits its effectiveness in DUNE, where most events in which such particle ID would be beneficial are multi-particle, but %there could be cases where it is a powerful supplement to the charge measurement.

\subsection{Design Considerations}
\label{sec:fdsp-pd-des-consid}

%\todo{\color{blue} Content: Segreto/Warner/Mualem}
%rjw 11/23/18 Add an intro
This section outlines the physical design considerations for a \dword{pds} 
to operate in a \lartpc and introduces the four major components of the \dword{pds} listed in Table~\ref{tab:pds-config-scope}. %, the light collectors, the silicon photosensors, the electronics, and the calibration and monitoring system.

%from sec n.2
The principal task of the \dword{spmod} \dword{pds} is to measure the \dword{vuv} scintillation light produced by ionizing tracks in the TPC within the geometrical constraints of the \dword{apa} structure. The modular arrangement of the \dword{spmod} calls for a configuration across the width of the cryostat starting with an \dword{apa} plane against one cryostat wall, and following with \dword{apa}s and \dword{cpa}s in the order  APA-CPA-APA-CPA-APA. %This means that t
%The central \dword{apa} collect charge and see scintillation light from \lar volumes on both sides, whereas those by the wall collect from only one side. 

The \dwords{pd} must fit within the innermost wire planes of the \dword{apa}s and be  installable through slots in a (wound) \dword{apa} frame (see Chapter~\ref{ch:fdsp-apa}).  Individual \dword{pd} modules are restricted to a profile of dimensions \SI{2.3}{cm} $\times$ \SI{11.8}{cm} $\times$ \SI{209.7}{cm}.  Ten \dword{pd} modules per \dword{apa} for a total of \num{1500} per \dword{spmod}.  Of these, \num{500} are mounted in central \dword{apa} frames and must collect light from both directions (dual-face), and \num{1000} are mounted in frames  near the vessel walls and collect light from only one direction (single-face).

Figures~\ref{fig:apa-frame-pds} and~\ref{fig:pds-pd-full-module} illustrate the baseline configuration of \dwords{pd} and \dword{apa}s in a \dword{spmod}.

It is most cost-effective for the \dword{pds} in a massive \lartpc like the \dword{spmod} to collect scintillation light from large areas and channel it 
efficiently towards much smaller photosensors that produce an electrical signal. 
This paradigm %for the detection of \lar scintillation light 
depends on the use of chemical wavelength shifters since most commercial cryogenic large area photosensors currently available are not directly sensitive to \dword{vuv} radiation. This is primarily due to the lack of transparency of fused silica and glass optical windows. 

The most widely used wavelength shifter for \lar detectors is \dword{tpb}\footnote{1,1,4,4-Tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene, supplier: Sigma-Aldrich\textregistered{}, \url{https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/}.}, which absorbs \dword{vuv} photons and re-emits them with a spectrum centered around \SI{420}{nm}, close to %where most commercial photosensors have their maximum quantum efficiency for photoconversion.

%rjw 11/223/18 Remove the following - what matters at this stage are the measurements we are doing with our prototypes and how those are modeled in our simulations 
%Though \dword{tpb} has been utilized quite extensively with great success, there are recent publications that warrant caution. For example, until recently the conversion efficiency of \dword{tpb} in coating was taken to be high, approaching or even exceeding \num{100}\% (possible by multi-photon emission), however a recent arXiv paper~\cite{Benson:2017vbw} refutes this previous frequently referenced result. Using much of the same equipment but replacing a damaged reference photodiode, the authors (including an author of the previous paper) report a measurement for the quantum efficiency of \num{40}\% for incident \SI{127}{nm} light. 

%%rjw 11/23/18 we may want to use this reference later in the x-arapuca section 
%Another recent paper\cite{Asaadi:2018ixs} reports that some methods used to coat surfaces with \dword{tpb} suffered loss of the \dword{tpb} coating in \lar, whereas there is no measurable effect if the fluor is dissolved in a polymer matrix. These developments will be followed carefully and highlight the importance of the ongoing R\&D and prototype program.

%The physical dimension of the \dword{pd} system is constrained by the need to fit within the innermost wire planes of the \dwords{apa} and to be installed through slots in the \dword{apa} mechanical frame after it is wound (see Chapter~\ref{ch:fdsp-apa}).  Individual \dword{pd} modules will be restricted to be within an envelope in the form of a long, thin box with dimensions \SI{2.3}{cm} $\times$ \SI{11.8}{cm} $\times$ \SI{209.7}{cm}.  There will be ten \dword{pd} modules per \dword{apa}, for a total of \num{1500} modules.  Of these, \num{500} will be mounted in central APA frames and will require the ability to collect light from both directions, and \num{1000} will be mounted in APA frames mounted near the vessel walls and will only require light collection from one direction.

%\fixme{anne moved the following from the sipm overview section 12/29. Nothing was here for sipms.}
Because of the size constraints imposed by the \dword{apa}, in each light collector concept considered for the \dword{spmod}  
a compact silicon photosensor rather than a traditional photomultiplier must be used to perform the final stage of converting a visible wavelength photon into an electrical signal. 
Distinct from most previous HEP applications of these devices, they must operate reliably for many years at \lar temperatures. 
Experience with a promising early candidate that failed in later batches due to an unadvertised change in the fabrication process emphasizes the importance of a multi-source approach with active engagement of potential vendors to develop a device expressly for cryogenic operation.

A final but significant consideration for the \dword{pds} design is the presence in the \lartpc of the long-lived cosmogenic radioisotope \Ar39, which has a specific activity in argon extracted from the atmosphere of approximately \SI{1}{Bq/kg}~\cite{bkds}. The isotope undergoes beta decay %with 
at a mean beta energy of \SI{220}{keV} with an endpoint of \SI{565}{keV}, and makes up $\sim$70\% of the radiological background signal.
In the \SI{10}{kt} \dword{fd} modules this leads to a rate of more than \SI{10}{MHz} of very short ($\sim$\SI{1}{mm}) tracks uniformly distributed throughout the module, each of which produces several thousand \dword{vuv} scintillation photons. This continuous background impacts the \dword{daq}, trigger, and spatial granularity required of the \dword{pds}.

We distinguish two levels of %requirements 
specifications for the \dword{pds} necessary to achieve the DUNE science objectives. The first %consists of the requirements on the

the detector hardware performance required to make those measurements, such as the sensitivity to the produced light signal per unit of deposited energy (light yield). 

Table~\ref{tab:pds-sys-req} summarizes the first level %requirements
specifications: 
\fixme{This text will change when the final table goes in (Anne)}
The first row attempts to ensure high efficiency and good energy resolution for proton decay and atmospheric neutrinos.  The second row establishes that a timing measurement is required for event localization (in conjunction with the TPC drift time measurement) and targets core collapse \dword{snb} neutrinos. The third row identifies that there much be sufficient dynamic range in the electronics to over the range of energy deposition of all events of science interest. The final row describes a measurement \textit{goal} that the collaboration believes would extend the capability of the system but is not considered a requirement to achieve the core science goals. Specifically, we establish a goal to measure the energy in scintillation light from \dword{snb} events near the peak of the spectrum ($\sim$\SI{20}{MeV}) with a precision similar to that of the ionization measurement. 
The combined measurement of ionization charge and scintillation light has been shown to improve the determination of the energy deposition of an event. 
% Per study by Bishu 12/3/18  rjw
We note that the smearing of the observed charged particle energy due the physics of the neutrino interaction (such as unobserved neutrons) is $\sim$18\% at the peak of the spectrum.
%In the past year, the potential for \lar scintillation light to contribute to the energy reconstruction of events has recently been recognized, in particular for lower energy events such as from \dwords{snb}(\num{10}-\SI{100}{MeV}).

In Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-design} we present a design that meets or exceeds the specifications while respecting the significant constraints imposed by the physical structure and size of the \dword{spmod}. Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-validation} summarizes an extensive set of prototypes that provide validation of the assumptions used in the design and the results of simulations that establish relationships between the performance specifications and the measurement requirements of Table~\ref{tab:pds-sys-req}.

%In the following we will distinguish between the terms photon \textit{collection} efficiency and photon \textit{detection} efficiency (PDE). Collection efficiency is the number of visible photons delivered to the \dwords{sipm} divided by the number of \dword{vuv} photons incident on the \dword{pd} module active area; this parameter is used to report results of calculations or simulations of predicted device performance independent of the \dword{sipm} used.  Detection efficiency is the number of detected \phel{}s from the \dword{sipm}(s) divided by the number of \dword{vuv} photons incident on the \dword{pd} module active area; this is generally the result of a direct measurement unless the detailed performance of the \dword{sipm} is known and divided out. 
%The effective area of a \dword{pd} module is another useful figure-of-merit that is defined to be the photon detection efficiency multiplied by the photon collecting area of a \dword{pd} module. 

%Numerous \dword{pd} photon collector module options were investigated prior to the formation of the \single \dword{pd} consortium, of which four were selected for further development.

The \dword{xarapu}, adopted for the baseline design and detailed in 
%Section~\ref{ssec:fdsp-pd-pc-arapuca}, 
Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-lc},
is an evolution of the ARAPUCA concept that combines its light trapping capability with the collection and transport capabilities of light guides.   

The ARAPUCA concept takes advantage of a new approach to \lar scintillation photon detection where the effective detection area is increased by trapping photons inside a flat box (cell) with highly reflective internal surfaces until reflections guide them to active photosensors of relatively small area. 
\dword{xarapu} includes placement of an acrylic wavelength-shifting light guide inside the cell, occupying a portion of the volume. Photons trapped in the light guide are wavelength-shifted and transported to the photosensors via total internal reflection with high efficiency. 

 % \dword{sipm}~\cite{arapuca_jinst}. 

Photon trapping is achieved through a novel use of wavelength-shifting and the technology of the dichroic shortpass optical filter. These commercially available filters are created by using multilayer thin films that %have the property of being 
are highly transparent to photons with a wavelength below a tunable cutoff, %while being 
with transmission typically greater than 95\%, yet almost perfectly reflective to photons with a wavelength above the cutoff.  Such a filter coated with either one or two different wavelength-shifters, depending on the detailed implementation, forms the entrance window to a cell whose internal surfaces are covered by highly reflective acrylic foils
%(3M-Vikuiti ESR \footnote{3M Vikuiti\texttrademark\ ~foils. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikuiti.}, for example), 
except for a small fraction occupied by \dwords{sipm}.

%To act as a photon trap, the wavelength-shifter deposited on the outer face of the dichroic filter must have its emission wavelength less than the cut-off wavelength of the filter, below which transmission is typically greater than 95\%. 
For the collector to act as a photon trap, the emission wavelength of the wavelength-shifter deposited on the outer face of the dichroic filter must be less than the cutoff wavelength of the filter. 
%, below which transmission is typically greater than 95\%. 
The transmitted photons pass through the filter where they encounter a second wavelength-shifter %either on the inner surface of the filter or coated on the reflecting inner surfaces of the box, 
with an emission spectrum greater than the cutoff wavelength, thus trapping them. 
%The location of the second wavelength-shifter is different in the single- and dual-face cells.
%In a single-face cell, the filter is coated also on the inside surface with a wavelength shifter; in a dual-face cell
%\fixme{In a single-face cell, the filter is coated also on the inside surface with a wavelength shifter; in a dual-face cell check and come back - Anne}

Trapped photons reflect off the inner walls and the filter surface(s) (of reflectivity typically greater than \SI{98}{\%}) 
and have a high probability of impinging on a \dword{sipm} before being lost to absorption. The concept is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:arapuca}\footnote{In the original ARAPUCA concept, the second wavelength-shifter was coated on the inner surface of the filter and the WLS plate shown in the figure was absent.}.
Validation of the ARAPUCA concept is described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-validation}.
%It is easy to show that, for small values of \dword{sipm} coverage of the internal surface, the amplification factor is equal to $A=1/(2(1-R))$, where R is the average value of the reflectivity of the internal surfaces; for an average reflectivity of 0.95 the amplification factor is equal to ten.

While the ARAPUCA modules deployed in \dword{pdsp} collect light from only one direction, the next generation \dword{xarapu} can be deployed as either single-face or dual-face readout by using either an opaque reflector plate (single) or a second dichroic filter window (dual) on the second face. 
Figure~\ref{fig:3dtpc-pd} shows how a light-collector module is incorporated into an \dword{apa}. An identical modular mounting scheme was used for each of the three options investigated\footnote{Two wavelength-shifter-coated light guide options were also investigated in detail over several years.}. One module spans the width of an \dword{apa}.

The light collector design has the flexibility to accommodate greater demands, such as might be desired for \dword{sbn} physics, without major changes. One example is to increase the number of \dwords{sipm} to increase light yield, which could be incorporated quite late in the final design stages since it would not involve significant mechanical changes.

\subsubsection{Silicon Photosensors} 


The \dword{spmod} \dword{pds} uses a multi-step approach to scintillation light detection with final stage of conversion into electrical charge performed by silicon photomultipliers (\dwords{sipm}). Robust photon detection efficiency, low operating voltages, small size, and ruggedness make their use attractive in the \single design where the photon detectors must fit inside the \dword{apa} frames. 

Based on extensive testing and experience with the vendor, we have selected a \SI{6}{mm}$\times$\SI{6}{mm} \dwords{mppc} % (Multi-Pixel Photon Counters) 
produced by Hamamatsu\footnote{Hamamatsu\texttrademark{} Photonics K.K., \url{http://www.hamamatsu.com/}.} (Japan) as the current baseline \dword{sipm} device. 
We are also vigorously pursuing an alternative based on the design of a device developed for operation in \lar by the DarkSide experiment collaboration and Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK)\footnote{Fondazione Bruno Kessler\texttrademark{}, \url{https://www.fbk.eu}.} (Italy).

The baseline \dword{pds} design has 192 \num{6}$\times$\SI{6}{mm$^2$} \dwords{mppc} per \dword{pd} module with groups of 48 \dwords{mppc} electrically ganged into four electronics readout channels. This leads to a total of 288,000 \dwords{mppc} per \dword{spmod}. 



%The size of currently available \dwords{sipm} (typically less than \SI{1}{cm$^2$}) is far smaller than the spatial granularity required for the experiment, so the output of individual devices will be electrically summed (ganged) to reduce the electronics channel count. This could be achieved either by simply connecting together the output of multiple devices, passive ganging, or using active components, active ganging, if the signal is too degraded for the passive approach. An optimal solution could involve a combination of the two approaches.

\subsubsection{Readout Electronics} 

%\fixme{rjw 11/25/18 Note: This is Design Consideration section so should just be on high level considerations not implementation }
%\fixme{DWW  The mu2e WFD front end electronics are now the baseline.  This sections needs modification--  I think we should mention charge integration, but greatly reduce the prominence.  The last sentence in this paragraph buries the lead.}
%\fixme{modifed below by Djurcic 11/29/18; need further understand what the "summing" baseline and come back here}

%\fixme{12/1/18 rjw added a few words to make it more like Design Considerations, but this should be fleshed out by conveners. (The paragraphs that followed were specifics on using Mu2e rather than SSP so moved to the Design section)}

%The \dword{pds} design requires the electronic readout system to collect and process electric signals from photosensors in \lar  to provide the interface to trigger and timing systems to support data reduction and classification, and to enable data transfer to an offline storage system for physics analysis. The quantitative requirements for the system are driven by numerous top level by specifications that impact signal size sensitivity, signal to noise, timing resolution, event size and data transfer limits from the DAQ, power needs and dissipation limits, channel density and channel count, and cost. 

The \dword{pds} design requires that the electronic readout system collect and process electric signals from photosensors in \lar to (1) provide the interface to trigger and timing systems, % to support data reduction and classification, 
and (2) enable data transfer to an offline storage system for physics analysis. The quantitative requirements for the system are driven by numerous \dword{fd} level specifications that impact signal size sensitivity, \dword{s/n}, timing resolution, event size and data transfer limits from the \dword{daq}, power needs and dissipation limits, channel density and channel count, and cost. 

%\fixme{rjw maybe a reference to Specifications tables here...}

%Tables~\ref{tab:spec:time-resolution} and \ref{tab:spec:light-yield}.

%rjw 12/1/18 The following seemed more like Design than "Considerations".... moved it to that section
%
%Based on successful design, fabrication, operation and performance of \dword{ssp} readout in \dword{pdsp}, and with initial high-quality beam and cosmic ray day data collected by \dword{pdsp} photon system, we have decided to further cost-optimize the readout electronics. To that end we adopted a solution based on ultrasound ASIC chips, rather than digitizer based on flash ADCs. Inspiration for such a cost-effective front-end comes from the system developed for the Mu2e experiment cosmic ray tagger readout system.
%Both systems are currently used in the photon detector validation process. The latter system performs a lower-cost waveform digitization based on lower sampling rate commercial ASICs, and enables a thorough investigation of the photosensor signals, particularly as we investigate the impact of electrically ganging multiple \dwords{sipm}. 

%With the cost-effective front-end baseline based on ultrasound ASIC, the evolution of the readout electronics for the final system will be strongly influenced by the outcomes of \dword{mc} simulations that are in progress. Of particular interest is the extent to which pulse shape capabilities are important to maximizing sensitivity to low energy neutrino interactions from \dwords{snb}. 

%%Initial \dword{mc} simulations suggest that it may not be necessary to fully digitize the \dword{sipm} waveforms in order to achieve the \dword{pd} performance requirements.   Charge integration electronic readout systems, which offer the promise of significantly lower cost and smaller cabling harnesses, are under investigation and are expected to be the baseline solution.


\subsection{Options to Improve Uniformity of Response} 
% rjw 1/13/19 Shorten this section in the overview to bare minimum.

Since the \dword{pd} modules are installed only in the \dword{apa}, light collection is not uniform over the entire active volume of the TPC. 
Though not necessary to meet the DUNE performance specifications, improving the uniformity of the response would increase the trigger efficiency, simplify the analysis for \dword{snb} neutrinos and increase the light yield of the detector, which could enable enhanced calorimetric measurements based on light emitted by the ionizing particles.
The primary source of non-uniformity of response is that the Rayleigh scattering length for \SI{127}{nm} scintillation photons is relatively short compared to the size of the TPC active volume.   
As options, in parallel to the baseline design we are pursuing two options that convert \SI{127}{nm} scintillation photons to longer wavelength photons with longer Rayleigh scattering length, providing a significant improvement in the light collection uniformity:

\begin{itemize}
\item Use of a wavelength-shifter-coated cathode plane - Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-enh-cathode}.
\item Use of trace amount of xenon in the \dword{lar} - Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-enh-xenon}.
\end{itemize}

% 1/13/19 Removed the following to de-emphasize them per TB request.
%We describe two options that convert \SI{127}{nm} scintillation photons to longer wavelength photons with longer Rayleigh scattering length, providing a significant improvement in the light collection uniformity. 

%\subsubsection{Wavelength-Shifter-Coated Cathode Plane}

%This option, described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-enh-cathode}, involves the installation of a reflective foil coated with wavelength-shifter on the TPC cathode. In addition to improved uniformity of response, it is possible that this option will allow removal of the \Ar39 background, which may otherwise cause a huge rate for events near the anode plane. 

%The light collectors would require  good  sensitivity to visible light, which the current implementation of the \dword{xarapu} lacks. Either changing the external \dword{xarapu} wavelength-shifter or leaving some detectors uncoated could enable this capability.
%The mechanical and operational impact of installation of a coated reflective foil on the cathode is under discussion with the \dword{hv} consortium.

%\subsubsection{Xenon Doping}
%This option involves doping the \lar volume with trace amounts of xenon (\SIrange{2}{10}{ppm}), which would result in the conversion of the \lar \SI{127}{nm} light to \SI{174}{nm} light throughout the \dword{lar} volume and could also increase the total light yield. This option would  simplify the fabrication and lower the cost of \dword{xarapu} since the thin coating of wavelength-shifter on the dichroic filter windows would no longer be required.
