The DUNE \dword{fd} consists of detector systems for charge and light produced by an ionization event in the \lartpc.  The charge detection system permits both calorimetry and position determination, with two of the three spatial coordinates ($y$ and $z$)  established by the position of the \dword{apa} wires receiving the charge and the third ($x$) by the arrival time of the charge.  Locating the $x$ position requires an independent determination of the time of the ionization event, a clock start time.  Two systems provide this in DUNE:  the Fermilab accelerator system for neutrino beam related events and the \dword{pds}.  

Neutrino \dword{cpv} and other elements of the DUNE long-baseline neutrino program are possible without data from the \dword{pds}.  The neutrino beam timing allows full functionality of the \dword{apa}s, and the deep underground location reduces the possibility of in-time background events from cosmic rays and other sources to a negligible level.  
Similarly, DUNE can detect \dwords{snb} originating within the galaxy without the \dword{pds} since the presence of thousands of low-energy neutrino events, even if they consist only of few millimeter long tracks, provides an unambiguous signal in the TPC.
By contrast, DUNE's nucleon decay physics could not be executed without the \dword{pds}.  The inability to establish a clock start time (\tzero) would make it impossible to determine whether a candidate proton decay event was fully contained in the detector volume or associated with objects entering the detector from the outside.  Determining \tzero will also allow the energy reconstructed by the TPC to be corrected for charge lost due to electron capture and other transport effects in the TPC. This physics sets the requirement on minimum light yield in the dimmest regions of the detector far from the photon detectors (SP-FD-3) and timing resolution (SP-FD-4), described further in Appendix~\ref{subsec:fdsp-pd-simphys-ndk}.

While only absolutely required for proton decay searches, the \dword{pds} directly enhances physics capabilities for all three DUNE physics drivers, opens up prospects for further physics explorations, and contributes to a more robust set of operating points of the detector that help all physics.   For \dword{snb} neutrino events, the \dword{pds} allows for proper location of the event vertex, and improves energy resolution by allowing for position-dependent energy corrections and complimentary direct calorimetric measurements, 
improving energy resolution and possibly greater sensitivity to underlying supernova dynamical models.  The \dword{pds} also enables a complementary triggering scheme for the burst itself, increasing 
reliability, reducing dead time, and extending the sensitivity further out to nearby dwarf galaxies (see Appendix~\ref{subsec:fdsp-pd-simphys-snb}). Applications to supernova physics set the average light yield requirement (SP-FD-3).

\fixme{AIH/ES: LBNC the commentary here (next para) suggests that there is an optimum E field balancing light and charge?? Is that the case??}
\forlbnc{Presumably this question is asking if we should move to lower field to get more light? The answer to that is no. At 50 V/cm, we already have 60\% of the energy going into light, though the charge is generally a higher resolution measurement. I have removed the line about increasing light yield with lowered charge since photon count is generally not the limiting factor in energy resolution with the X-ARAPUCAs. However, the point about the PDS being able to provide back-stop energy resolution if the TPC resolution is degraded is still true, and is kept.}

The \dword{pds} can also be used to directly measure energy calorimetrically for all classes of events, working as a cross-check to the energy measured by the TPC or improving the resolution when both measurements are used together (see Appendix~\ref{subsec:fdsp-pd-simphys-beam}).  In the event that the DUNE TPC could not operate at its goal electric field of \SI{500}{V/cm}, the \dword{pds} energy measurements could compensate for lessened charge detector performance because light production increases relative to that of free charge for lower \efield{}.

The \dword{pds} could open new areas of investigation.  The few-MeV scale solar neutrino interactions occur as isolated events in time and space.  Suppression of radiological and noise related backgrounds to pull out a signal for these events likely requires  redundant measurements with charge and light.  The \dword{pds} may also provide a means for identifying events with Michel electrons produced from the decay of a stopped muon. Tagging these electrons can be used to estimate the antineutrino content of the beam flux or further reduce nucleon decay backgrounds (see Section~\ref{subsec:fdsp-pd-simphys-beam}).
 
%The remaining sections further develop the specification and design of a \dword{pds} that supports DUNE physics.

The Physics TDR (Vol.~2) describes the detailed physics simulations of the main DUNE physics drivers.  
% rjw 4/7/19 Last sentence replaced with move of simulation to the appendix
%In the following section we describe additional simulations performed to establish the \dword{pds} performance specifications that are met or exceeded by the design described in the rest of this chapter.
The \dword{pds} performance specifications have been established and validated in part by simulation.  Details of this simulation, which includes non-uniformity in light yield due to the optical properties of the argon, electronics response, and realistic reconstruction, are presented in Appendix~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-simphys}.

% Anne took this part out 12/27: The \dword{pds} is an essential detector subsystem of a DUNE \dword{spmod}. The detection of the prompt scintillation light signal, emitted in coincidence with an ionizing event inside the active volume, allows the determination of the time of occurrence of an event of interest with much higher precision than charge collected from ionization in the TPC. This capability is most critical for the primary DUNE science objectives that are uncorrelated with the timing signal from the neutrino source at \fnal, such as proton decay and neutrinos from a \dword{snb}, and for the ancillary science program including measurements of neutrino oscillation phenomena using atmospheric neutrinos. 

% Anne took this part out 12/27: Timing information from the \dword{pd} and TPC systems allows determination of the drift time of the ionizing particles. Knowledge of the drift time provides localization of the event inside the active volume and %provides the ability to enables corrections to the measured charge for effects that depend on the drift path length, purity of \lar, or for specific locations in the detector %if there are due to non-uniformities.  This correction is important for %the reconstruction of the energy deposited by the ionizing event. In addition to allowing optimum track reconstruction, scintillation light measured by the system may also be used as a trigger and for improved calorimetric measurement in combination with charge measurement.

\subsection{Specifications}
Based on the physics drivers and additional simulation studies described in Appendix~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-simphys}, Table~\ref{tab:specs:SP-PDS} summarizes the \dword{pds} specifications necessary to achieve the DUNE science objectives. 
In the remainder of this chapter we present a design that meets or exceeds the specifications. Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-validation} summarizes an extensive set of prototypes that provide validation of the assumptions used in the design.

\subsection{Scope}
The scope of the \single \dword{pds}, provided by the DUNE \dword{pds} consortium, includes the selection and procurement of materials for, and the fabrication, testing, delivery and installation of light collectors (\dword{xarapu}), silicon photosensors (\dwords{sipm}), electronics, and a calibration and monitoring system. The baseline components are listed in Table~\ref{tab:pds-config-scope}.

Although the configuration of \single and \dual \dwords{lartpc} led to significantly different solutions for the \dword{pds}, a number of scientific and technical issues impact them in a similar way, and the consortia for these two systems cooperate closely on these. See \voltitledp{}, Chapter~5.

\subsection{Principle of Operation}
%\{moved this up to intro for principle of operation (anne)}
\lar is  an abundant scintillator and emits about \SI{40}{photons/keV} when excited  by minimum ionizing particles~\cite{Doke:1990rza} %,
%There are a number of others possible - see email from ES 4/11/18
in the absence of external \efield{}s. In the presence of \efield{}s the yield is reduced due to recombination; for the nominal DUNE \dword{spmod} field of \SI{500}{V/cm} the yield is approximately \SI{24}{photons/keV.}~\cite{PhysRevB.20.3486}. 
% From ES:  "Dynamical behavior of free electrons in the recombination process in liquid argon, krypton, and xenon", S.Kubota, M.Hishida, M.Suzuki, J.Ruan(Gen), Phys. Rev. B20 (1979), 3486 and Ruan(Gen), Jian-zhi,

%Ettore: I like to use 1.3 musec because is what we measured, but the convention seems to be 1.5 - I propose to switch to 1.5 muec}
As depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:scintAr}, the passage of ionizing radiation in \lar produces excitations and ionization of the argon atoms that ultimately result in the formation of the excited dimer Ar$^*_2$.  
Photon emission proceeds through the de-excitation of the lowest lying singlet and triplet excited states, $^{1}\Sigma$ and 
$^{3}\Sigma$, to the dissociative ground state. The de-excitation from the $^{1}\Sigma$ state is very fast and has a characteristic time of the order of $\tau_{fast}$ $\simeq$ \SI{6}{ns}. The de-excitation from the $^{3}\Sigma$, state is much slower since it is forbidden by the selection rules; it has a characteristic time of $\tau_{slow}$ $\simeq$ \SI{1.5}{$\mu$sec}. %\SI{1.3}{$\mu$sec}.   
In both decays, photons are emitted in a \SI{10}{nm} band centered around \SI{127}{nm}, which is in the Vacuum Ultra-Violet (\dword{vuv}) region of the electromagnetic spectrum~\cite{Heindl:2010zz}.
The relative intensity of the  fast %and 
versus the slow component is related to the ionization density of \lar and depends on the ionizing particle: \num{0.3} for electrons, \num{1.3} for alpha particles and \num{3} for neutrons~\cite{PhysRevB.27.5279}.

This phenomenon is the basis for the particle discrimination capabilities of \lar exploited by experiments that have the capacity to separate the two components, but its utility is effectively restricted to events with single charged particles. This %would 
limits its effectiveness in DUNE, where most events in which such particle ID would be beneficial are multi-particle, but %there could be cases where it is a powerful supplement to the charge measurement.

\subsection{Design Considerations}
\label{sec:fdsp-pd-des-consid}
%rjw 11/23/18 Add an intro
%This section outlines the physical design considerations for a \dword{pds} to operate in a \lartpc and introduces the four major components of the \dword{pds} listed in Table~\ref{tab:pds-config-scope}.

The principal task of the \dword{spmod} \dword{pds} is to measure the \dword{vuv} scintillation light produced by ionizing tracks in the TPC within the geometrical constraints of the \dword{apa} structure. The modular arrangement of the \dword{spmod} calls for a configuration across the width of the cryostat starting with an \dword{apa} plane against one cryostat wall, and following with \dword{apa}s and \dword{cpa}s in the order  APA-CPA-APA-CPA-APA.
The structure of the APA, along with the imperative to maximize the active volume of \dword{lar}, precludes the use of traditional large area photomultiplier tubes.  

A solution that reduces the impact of the \dword{pds} on the active volume to zero is to place the light collector modules in the inactive space between the innermost wire planes of the \dword{apa}s. To satisfy APA fabrication constraints and mechanical integrity, the modules must also be installable through slots in a (wound) \dword{apa} frame (see Chapter~\ref{ch:fdsp-apa}).  Individual \dword{pd} modules are restricted to a profile of dimensions \SI{2.3}{cm} $\times$ \SI{11.8}{cm} $\times$ \SI{209.7}{cm}.  There are ten \dword{pd} modules per \dword{apa} for a total of \num{1500} per \dword{spmod}.  Of these, \num{500} are mounted in central \dword{apa} frames and must collect light from both directions (dual-face), and \num{1000} are mounted in frames  near the vessel walls and collect light from only one direction (single-face).
Figure~\ref{fig:apa-frame-pds}
illustrates the baseline configuration of PD modules and \dword{apa}s in a \dword{spmod}. 

To detect scintillation light over a large area in a compact space requires a multi-step process.  First, the \dword{vuv} scintillation photons are converted to longer wavelength by chemical wavelength shifters. 
\footnote{The most widely used wavelength shifter for \lar detectors is  1,1,4,4-Tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene (\dword{tpb}), 
%\footnote{supplier: Sigma-Aldrich\textregistered{}, \url{https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/}.}, 
which absorbs \dword{vuv} photons and re-emits them with a spectrum centered around \SI{420}{nm}, close to the wavelength of maximum quantum efficiency for photoconversion in most commercial photosensors.} 
These photons are then channelled as efficiently as possible towards much smaller photosensors that produce an electrical signal. Due to the severe space constraints these must be silicon photosensors with dimensions of just a few millimeters,  rather than a traditional photomultiplier.
Another requirement, distinct from most previous HEP applications of these devices, is that they must operate reliably for many years at \lar temperatures.

An operational consideration for the \dword{pds} design is the presence in the \lartpc of the long-lived cosmogenic radioisotope \Ar39, which has a specific activity in argon extracted from the atmosphere of approximately \SI{1}{Bq/kg}~\cite{bkds}. The isotope undergoes beta decay at a mean beta energy of \SI{220}{keV} with an endpoint of \SI{565}{keV}, and makes up $\sim$70\% of the radiological background signal.
In the \SI{10}{kt} \dword{fd} modules this leads to a rate of more than \SI{10}{MHz} of very short ($\sim$\SI{1}{mm}) tracks uniformly distributed throughout the module, each of which produces several thousand \dword{vuv} scintillation photons. This continuous background impacts the \dword{daq}, trigger and spatial granularity required of the \dword{pds}.

%Though \dword{tpb} has been utilized quite extensively with great success, there are recent publications that warrant caution. For example, until recently the conversion efficiency of \dword{tpb} in coating was taken to be high, approaching or even exceeding \num{100}\% (possible by multi-photon emission), however a recent arXiv paper~\cite{Benson:2017vbw} refutes this previous frequently referenced result. Using much of the same equipment but replacing a damaged reference photodiode, the authors (including an author of the previous paper) report a measurement for the quantum efficiency of \num{40}\% for incident \SI{127}{nm} light.

These developments will be followed carefully and highlight the importance of the ongoing R\&D and prototype program.

\subsubsection{Light Collectors} 
\label{sssec:photoncollectors}

DUNE investigated numerous \dword{pd} light collector module options prior to the formation of the \single \dword{pd} consortium -- we selected four for further development. 
Two of the designs, \dword{sarapu}\footnote{\textit{Arapuca} is the name of a simple trap for catching birds originally used by the Guarani people of Brazil.} (\textbf{S}tandard-) and \dword{xarapu} (e\textbf{X}tended-), use a relatively new concept that is scalable and designed to provide  
significantly better performance than the other approaches. Functionally, ARAPUCA is a light trap that captures wavelength-shifted photons inside boxes with highly reflective internal surfaces until they are eventually detected by \dwords{sipm}.  The two other designs are based on the use of wavelength-shifters and long plastic light guides coupled to \dwords{sipm} at the ends. Their performance could meet the basic physics requirements but with only a small safety margin and they are not easily scalable within the geometric constraints of the \dword{spmod}. 

%Though the ARAPUCA concept is relatively recent -- it was first proposed in 2015 -- a series of prototypes on an evolving design has resulted in detection efficiency measurements with \dword{sarapu} ranging from  \num{0.4}\% to \num{1.8}\% (Section~\ref{ssec:valid-mcell}), demonstrating the potential for substantially higher performance than the light guide designs that were also considered. %\dword{mc} simulations show that improvements to the basic design could lead to detection efficiencies at the level of several per cent. 
%This concept also naturally allows for finer spatial segmentation within the detector modules than is the case for the light guide designs. 

%The baseline design, the \dword{xarapu} detailed in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-lc}, is an evolution of the original ARAPUCA concept that combines the desirable characteristics of both a light guide and a photon trap.  
%Figure~\ref{fig:3dtpc-pd} shows a \threed model of the \single TPC and a detail of the anode plane where the three photon collector technologies developed to full-scale prototypes for \dword{pdsp} are illustrated; the \dword{spmod} will use just \dword{xarapu}.



%In the following we will distinguish between the terms photon \textit{collection} efficiency and photon \textit{detection} efficiency (PDE). Collection efficiency is the number of visible photons delivered to the \dwords{sipm} divided by the number of \dword{vuv} photons incident on the \dword{pd} module active area; this parameter is used to report results of calculations or simulations of predicted device performance independent of the \dword{sipm} used.  Detection efficiency is the number of detected \phel{}s from the \dword{sipm}(s) divided by the number of \dword{vuv} photons incident on the \dword{pd} module active area; this is generally the result of a direct measurement unless the detailed performance of the \dword{sipm} is known and divided out. 
%The effective area of a \dword{pd} module is another useful figure-of-merit that is defined to be the photon detection efficiency multiplied by the photon collecting area of a \dword{pd} module. 

%Numerous \dword{pd} photon collector module options were investigated prior to the formation of the \single \dword{pd} consortium, of which four were selected for further development. 


%\{I moved the "DUNE investigated" text to the validation section and moved the top of the light collector design text  1.2.1 here (anne)}

%\fixme{rjw 1/13/19 This section was reworked. Replaced ARAPUCA concept cartoon with one specific to X-ARAPUCA}

%The \dword{xarapu}, adopted for the baseline design and detailed in 
%Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-lc},
%is an evolution of the ARAPUCA concept, combining the light trapping capability of the initial designs with the collection and transport capabilities of light guides. Using the wavelength dependence of reflectivity of dichroic filters, combined with the light capturing of wavelength shifted light due to total reflection in \dword{wls} bars, \dword{xarapu} cells have demonstrated a very significant enhancement to the effective area of \dwords{sipm}.

%The ARAPUCA concept is a novel light collection enhancement device in which the effective probability of detecting an incident photon is increased by trapping photons inside a flat box (cell) with highly reflective internal surfaces until reflections guide them to active photosensors of relatively small area. 

%\fixme{need to add reference to protodune section}

%In addition to the total internal reflection inside the bar, additional 
In an \dword{sarapu} cell, enhanced photon trapping is achieved through the
use of wavelength-shifting plates and the technology of the dichroic shortpass optical filter. These commercially available filters are created by using multilayer thin films that are highly transparent to photons with a wavelength below a tunable cutoff, 
with transmission typically greater than 95\%, yet almost perfectly reflective to photons with a wavelength above the cutoff.  Such a filter forms the entrance window to a cell whose internal surfaces are covered by highly reflective acrylic foils
%(3M-Vikuiti ESR \footnote{3M Vikuiti\texttrademark\ ~foils. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikuiti.}, for example), 
except for a small fraction occupied by \dwords{sipm}.

%To act as a photon trap, the wavelength-shifter deposited on the outer face of the dichroic filter must have its emission wavelength less than the cut-off wavelength of the filter, below which transmission is typically greater than 95\%.

The transmitted photons pass through the filter where they encounter a second wavelength-shifter coated on either the inside surface of the filter plate or on the rear surface of the box.%inside the cell%either on the inner surface of the filter or coated on the reflecting inner surfaces of the box, 
This second wavelength shifter has an emission spectrum greater than the cutoff wavelength, thus trapping the photon inside the box.

Trapped photons reflect off the inner walls and the filter surface(s) (of reflectivity typically greater than \SI{98}{\%}) 
and have a high probability of impinging on a \dword{sipm} before being lost to absorption. 
Several iterations of \dword{sarapu} design were tested in small cryostats (Section~\ref{sec:sarapuca-prototypes}) and \dword{pdsp} (Section~\ref{sec:valid-pdsp}), establishing the viability of the concept for DUNE.

The \dword{xarapu}, adopted for the baseline design and detailed in

In the \dword{xarapu}, the secondary \dword{wls} layer of the \dword{sarapu} (a vacuum-deposited layer of \dword{wls} applied to the inner surfaces of the cell) is replaced by a \dword{wls} plate with an emission wavelength greater than the filter plate transmission frequency.  Wavelength shifted photons from this plate have two mechanisms for being transported to the photosensors inside the cell--either they are transported along the \dword{wls} plate to the photosensors via total internal reflection, or those escaping the plate are captured within the dichroic filter by the standard ARAPUCA effect.
The concept is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:arapuca}.
%\footnote{In the original ARAPUCA concept, the second wavelength-shifter was coated on the inner surface of the filter and the WLS plate shown in the figure is absent.}.
Validation of the \dword{xarapu} design is described in Sections~\ref{sec:xarapuca-unicamp} and \ref{sec:iceberg-teststand}.
%It is easy to show that, for small values of \dword{sipm} coverage of the internal surface, the amplification factor is equal to $A=1/(2(1-R))$, where R is the average value of the reflectivity of the internal surfaces; for an average reflectivity of 0.95 the amplification factor is equal to ten.

While the \dword{sarapu} modules deployed in \dword{pdsp} collect light from only one direction, the next generation \dword{xarapu} can be deployed as either single-face or dual-face readout by using either an opaque reflector plate (single) or a second dichroic filter window (dual) on the second face. 
Figure~\ref{fig:3dtpc-pd} shows how a light-collector module is incorporated into an \dword{apa}. One module spans the width of an \dword{apa}. Figure~\ref{fig:pds-pd-full-module} (left) shows a detail of the module where the 24 \dword{xarapu} cells are visible distributed either side of a signal summing and interface board that becomes enclosed by the hollow central beam of the \dword{apa} frame. Figure~\ref{fig:pds-pd-full-module} (right) illustrates how a module is inserted into an \dword{apa} frame.

The \dword{xarapu} light collector design has the flexibility to accommodate greater demands, such as might be desired for \dword{sbn} physics, without major changes. One example of this flexibility is the ability to increase the number of \dwords{sipm} to increase light yield, which could be incorporated quite late in the final design stages since it would not involve significant mechanical changes.

\subsubsection{Silicon Photosensors} 
\label{sssec:photosensors}
%\fixme{Originally intended for detailed design considerations - for an overview section it is too detailed. It will be greatly condensed - some of the following may get moved back to the Design section.}
%\fixme{rjw - For now copy the short summary from the design section to here...}

The \dword{spmod} \dword{pds} uses a multi-step approach to scintillation light detection with the final stage of conversion into electrical charge performed by silicon photomultipliers (\dwords{sipm}). Robust photon detection efficiency, low operating voltages, small size and ruggedness make their use attractive in the \single design where the photon detectors must fit inside the \dword{apa} frames. 

Based on extensive testing and experience with the vendor, we have selected a \SI{6}{mm}$\times$\SI{6}{mm} \dwords{mppc} % (Multi-Pixel Photon Counters) 
produced by Hamamatsu\footnote{Hamamatsu\texttrademark{} Photonics K.K., \url{http://www.hamamatsu.com/}.} (Japan) as the current baseline \dword{sipm} device. 
We are also vigorously pursuing an alternative based on the design of a device developed for operation in \lar by the DarkSide experiment collaboration and Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK)\footnote{Fondazione Bruno Kessler\texttrademark{}, \url{https://www.fbk.eu}.} (Italy).

The baseline \dword{pds} design has 192 \num{6}$\times$\SI{6}{mm$^2$} \dwords{mppc} per \dword{pd} module with groups of 48 \dwords{mppc} electrically ganged into four electronics readout channels. This leads to a total of 288,000 \dwords{mppc} per \dword{spmod}. 



%The size of currently available \dwords{sipm} (typically less than \SI{1}{cm$^2$}) is far smaller than the spatial granularity required for the experiment, so the output of individual devices will be electrically summed (ganged) to reduce the electronics channel count. This could be achieved either by simply connecting together the output of multiple devices, passive ganging, or using active components, active ganging, if the signal is too degraded for the passive approach. An optimal solution could involve a combination of the two approaches.

%\fixme{modifed below by Djurcic 11/29/18; need further understand what the "summing" baseline and come back here}

%\fixme{12/1/18 rjw added a few words to make it more like Design Considerations, but this should be fleshed out by conveners. (The paragraphs that followed were specifics on using Mu2e rather than SSP so moved to the Design section)}

%The \dword{pds} design requires the electronic readout system to collect and process electric signals from photosensors in \lar  to provide the interface to trigger and timing systems to support data reduction and classification, and to enable data transfer to an offline storage system for physics analysis. The quantitative requirements for the system are driven by numerous top level by specifications that impact signal size sensitivity, signal to noise, timing resolution, event size and data transfer limits from the DAQ, power needs and dissipation limits, channel density and channel count, and cost. 


The \dword{pds} design requires that the electronic readout system collect and process electric signals from photosensors in \lar to (1) provide the interface to trigger and timing systems, % to support data reduction and classification, 
and (2) enable data transfer to an offline storage system for physics analysis. The quantitative requirements for the system are driven by numerous \dword{fd} level specifications that impact signal size sensitivity, \dword{s/n}, timing resolution, event size and data transfer limits from the \dword{daq}, power needs and dissipation limits, channel density and channel count, and cost.

% rjw 4/19 The following was repetitive of the previous section and the reviewer felt it referred too much to future section and should just focus on the baseline as currently understood. Replaced. 
%As visualized in Figure~ \ref{fig:fig-pds-gang-jorge-1}, the scintillation light collected by ARAPUCA cells is detected by an array of \dwords{sipm} within each cell. These \dwords{sipm} are summed together to optimize light collection and reduce the channel count. We have shown in Section~\ref{sec:pds-valid-ganging} that an ensemble of 48 Hamamatsu \SI{6}{mm}$\times$\SI{6}{mm} \dwords{mppc} can be summed into a single channel by a combination of passive and active ganging.  In this scheme, a cold amplifier is used to adjust the \dword{mppc} output signal level to the input of a \dwords{fe} \dword{adc}, outside the cryostat, over  $\sim\,$\SI{20}{m} long signal cables. The cables will have cold and warm components, interfacing through dedicated signal feedthroughs. In \dword{pdsp} (Section~\ref{sec:ssp-protodune-electronics}) we have shown that a \SI{16}{m} long twisted-pair cable provides optimal \dword{s/n} input to common-mode noise rejection front-end digitizer.

As described in Section~\ref{sssec:photosensors}, each the electronic signal from a \dword{pd} module is formed from an ensemble of 48 Hamamatsu \dwords{mppc} summed into a single channel by a combination of passive and active ganging.  A cold amplifier is used to adjust the \dword{mppc} output signal level to the input of a \dwords{fe} \dword{adc}, outside the cryostat. The signal is transmitted over $\sim\,$\SI{20}{m} long twisted-pair cables, which provide  optimal \dword{s/n} input to common-mode noise rejection front-end digitizer. 
%The cables will have cold and warm components, interfacing through dedicated signal feedthroughs. In \dword{pdsp} (Section~\ref{sec:ssp-protodune-electronics}) we have shown that a \SI{16}{m} long twisted-pair cable provides optimal \dword{s/n} input to common-mode noise rejection front-end digitizer.
The digitizer is a low-cost solution based on commercial ultrasound \dword{asic} chips rather than digitizers based on flash \dwords{adc} used in \dword{pdsp}. Inspiration for this \dword{fe} comes from the system developed for the Mu2e experiment cosmic ray tagger readout system as described in Section~\ref{sec:electronics}.

%rjw 4/19 Removed the description of the future plans - this discussion appears in the Design section.
%We plan to further optimize and test the \dword{fe} electronics. 
%Ongoing simulation and testing efforts will inform the optimal sampling rate.
The \dword{fe} will continually digitize the input signals for each channel, and store waveforms and  event metadata that meet the trigger conditions. In an externally triggered waveform mode, the configured waveform window at the time of the external trigger is also stored. These internally or externally triggered waveforms are transmitted to the \dword{daq} board reader processes for storage. The \dword{daq} system and data storage limitations impose constraints on the data bandwidth, readout rates, and zero suppression. 

Single \phel signals from \Ar39 and radiological backgrounds will dictate threshold level adjustments.
We will configure the photon readout to trigger on signals from the central trigger and timing systems for a variety of configurable events, e.g., beam events, cosmic
muons, periodic triggering, random triggering, or any combination of
these. Special trigger conditions needed for a potential \dword{snb} observation will enable readout of all digitized data over predefined periods of time.
The interface design will define the power, grounding, and rack schemes.

%rjw 4/19 Removed the description of the future plans - this discussion appears in the Design section.
%A number of optimization and development tasks are still to be pursued, including incorporation and programming of high-performance  \dwords{fpga}, readout system optimization based on ongoing and planned \dword{pdsp} and ICEBERG tests, and improved understanding of sampling rates and dynamic ranges.


%rjw 12/1/18 The following seemed more like Design than "Considerations".... moved it to that section
%
%Based on successful design, fabrication, operation and performance of \dword{ssp} readout in \dword{pdsp}, and with initial high-quality beam and cosmic ray day data collected by \dword{pdsp} photon system, we have decided to further cost-optimize the readout electronics. To that end we adopted a solution based on ultrasound ASIC chips, rather than digitizer based on flash ADCs. Inspiration for such a cost-effective front-end comes from the system developed for the Mu2e experiment cosmic ray tagger readout system.
%Both systems are currently used in the photon detector validation process. The latter system performs a lower-cost waveform digitization based on lower sampling rate commercial ASICs, and enables a thorough investigation of the photosensor signals, particularly as we investigate the impact of electrically ganging multiple \dwords{sipm}. 

%With the cost-effective front-end baseline based on ultrasound ASIC, the evolution of the readout electronics for the final system will be strongly influenced by the outcomes of \dword{mc} simulations that are in progress. Of particular interest is the extent to which pulse shape capabilities are important to maximizing sensitivity to low energy neutrino interactions from \dwords{snb}. 

%%Initial \dword{mc} simulations suggest that it may not be necessary to fully digitize the \dword{sipm} waveforms in order to achieve the \dword{pd} performance requirements.   Charge integration electronic readout systems, which offer the promise of significantly lower cost and smaller cabling harnesses, are under investigation and are expected to be the baseline solution.


\subsection{Options to Improve Uniformity of Response} 
% rjw 1/13/19 Shorten this section in the overview to bare minimum.

\fixme{AIH: LBNC This issue of non-uniformity was not evident in earlier discussions. Is it taken into account in the simulations of energy resolution?? If not, what is the expected impact??}

\forlbnc{The simulation definitely includes this non-uniformity, and relatively pessimistic assumptions are made since there is significant uncertainty in the literature on Rayleigh scattering length in liquid argon. We have added brief mentions of the non-uniformity earlier in this section when the simulation is discussed.}

Since the \dword{pd} modules are installed only in the \dword{apa}, light collection is not uniform over the entire active volume of the TPC. 
Though not necessary to meet the DUNE performance specifications, improving the uniformity of the response would increase the trigger efficiency, simplify the analysis for \dword{snb} neutrinos and increase the light yield of the detector, which could enable enhanced calorimetric measurements based on light emitted by the ionizing particles.

The primary source of non-uniformity of response is that the Rayleigh scattering length for \SI{127}{nm} scintillation photons is relatively short compared to the size of the TPC active volume.   
As options, in parallel to the baseline design, we are pursuing two options that convert \SI{127}{nm} scintillation photons to longer wavelength photons with longer Rayleigh scattering length, providing a significant improvement in the light collection uniformity:

\begin{itemize}
\item Use of a wavelength-shifter-coated cathode plane - Appendix Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-enh-cathode}.
\item Use of trace amount of xenon in the \dword{lar} - Appendix Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-enh-xenon}.
\end{itemize}

% 1/13/19 Removed the following to de-emphasize them per TB request.
%We describe two options that convert \SI{127}{nm} scintillation photons to longer wavelength photons with longer Rayleigh scattering length, providing a significant improvement in the light collection uniformity. 

%\subsubsection{Wavelength-Shifter-Coated Cathode Plane}

%This option, described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-pd-enh-cathode}, involves the installation of a reflective foil coated with wavelength-shifter on the TPC cathode. In addition to improved uniformity of response, it is possible that this option will allow removal of the \Ar39 background, which may otherwise cause a huge rate for events near the anode plane. 

%The light collectors would require  good  sensitivity to visible light, which the current implementation of the \dword{xarapu} lacks. Either changing the external \dword{xarapu} wavelength-shifter or leaving some detectors uncoated could enable this capability.
%The mechanical and operational impact of installation of a coated reflective foil on the cathode is under discussion with the \dword{hv} consortium.

%\subsubsection{Xenon Doping}
%This option involves doping the \lar volume with trace amounts of xenon (\SIrange{2}{10}{ppm}), which would result in the conversion of the \lar \SI{127}{nm} light to \SI{174}{nm} light throughout the \dword{lar} volume and could also increase the total light yield. This option would  simplify the fabrication and lower the cost of \dword{xarapu} since the thin coating of wavelength-shifter on the dichroic filter windows would no longer be required.


\subsection{Overview Summary} 
\label{sec:fdsp-pd-ov-summ}

As described in Section~\ref{tab:pds-ndk}, the performance required for the \dword{pds} to achieve 99\% for tagging nucleon decay events at the furthest point (near the \dword{cpa}) is a light yield of \SI{0.5}{PE/MeV}, which corresponds to a collection efficiency of 1.3\% with the assumed \SI{60}{cm} Rayleigh scattering length. The light yield required to enable a calorimetric energy measurement for low-energy events like \dwords{snb} with the \dword{pds} establishes the light yield specification for the system (FD-SP-3 in Table~\ref{tab:specs:SP-PDS}) of \SI{20}{PE/MeV} averaged over the active volume, which corresponds to a collection efficiency of 2.6\% (Section~\ref{fig:pds-snb-calo}).

Although full validation of the \dword{spmod} \dword{pds} light collection system is still in progress, initial results on the \dword{xarapu} prototype are very encouraging - the single cell prototype (Section~\ref{sec:xarapuca-unicamp}) has achieved a detection efficiency of $\SI{3.5}{\%}$.  This is substantially higher than the requirements.
%04feb19 rjw changed  4.7 \pm 0.8 % to 3.5% per the results shown by Ettore at the collaboration meeting.

The measured detection efficiency in excess of the specification ensures a safety margin against degradation in performance of the optical components over time and failures of a fraction of inaccessible active components during long term operation of the detector. It also opens broader opportunities for the photon detection system to extend the physics reach of the experiment, perhaps in unanticipated ways.
