A \dword{lartpc} requires an equipotential cathode plane at \dword{hv} and a precisely regulated interior \efield to drive the
electrons from particle interactions to the sensor planes. For the \dword{dune} %\dlong{dp} (\dword{dp}) 
\dword{dp} technology, 
this requires a horizontal cathode plane, held at negative \dword{hv}; a horizontal \dword{crp} in the gas phase as described in Chapter~\ref{sec:fddp-crp-intro}; %and formed sets of conductors at graded voltages surrounding the the central drift volume, collectively called the \dword{fc}, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dune_dp_fd_hvs}. The \dword{fc} consists of electrically and mechanically continuous field shaping rings that provide voltage degradation in the vertical direction and forms one continuous active volume. (Anne edited)
and electrically and mechanically continuous  horizontal field-shaping rings that surround the central active drift volume, providing voltage degradation in the vertical direction, collectively called the \dword{fc}, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dune_dp_fd_hvs}.


The \dword{hv} consortium will provide a system that operates at the nominal voltage corresponding to the uniform \SI{500}{V/cm} \efield in the \dword{tpc} drift volume. 
%As a result, its systems %actually constitute a large fraction of the %total internal structures of the \dword{tpc}. % itself. 
Mechanical and structural concerns are taken into account, together with the electrical design to meet the requirements.

\section{Scope}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-scope}
The scope of the \dual \dword{hv} system, provided by the \dword{dune} \dword{hv} consortium includes selecting and procuring materials, as well as the fabrication, testing, delivery, and installation of the components needed to generate, distribute, and regulate the voltages that create a stable and precise \efield{} within the \dword{dpmod}. 

The \dual \dword{hv} system has the following components:

\begin{itemize}
\item \SI{-600}{kV} \dword{hv} power supply, cable, filters, and \fdth;
\item \dword{hv} extender and voltage degrader,
\item a horizontal cathode plane (\SI{60}{\m} long and \SI{12}{\m} wide) made of arrays of resistive elements placed approximately \SI{1.5}{\m} above the bottom of the cryostat;
\item \dwords{gp} below the cathode to protect the \dword{pd} array.
\item vertical \dword{fc} walls, \SI{12}{\m} tall surrounding the cathode and covering a total of \SI{144}{\m} circumference;
\item \dword{hv} return \fdth and resistor box.
\end{itemize}

The \dword{hv} system consists of components both exterior and interior to the cryostat. The \dword{hv} power supply is external and will be mounted on top of the \dword{hv} \fdth, eliminating the need for a thick dielectric layer on the \dword{hv} cable. 
The voltage passes through the cable, filters, and the \fdth into the cryostat where it is distributed by interior components that form part of the \dword{tpc} structure.  The internal \dword{hv} components, in fact, form a large fraction of the total internal structure of the \dword{tpc} itself, and  
 effectively bound the active volume of the \dword{detmodule}. The \dword{hv} system is a key to determining the event rate for all \dword{dune} physics processes. 
 Figure~\ref{fig:dune-dp-hvs}(a) is schematic overview of the \dword{hv} system (panels b-d show pictures of a few of the components from \dword{wa105}).

The system operates at the full range of voltages, 
$-$\dptargetdriftvoltpos to ground, inside the \dword{tpc} volume. 

The \single and \dual modules will use similar designs for some \dword{hv} system components, 
in particular, some aspects of the \dwords{fc} and their supporting beams. The \dword{dp} versions are described in this chapter. 
 %\fixme{for Anne  let's list sections where these components are described. Anne}.

The design presented in this chapter is primarily based on the \dword{pddp}, \dword{pdsp}, and \dword{wa105} experience. Scaling up from the size of these  prototypes presents some challenges that the \dword{dpmod} is designed to meet, e.g., 

%\subsection{Design Considerations}

%Among the design considerations are many challenges scaling up the \dword{pddp} \dword{tpc} design to the \dword{dune} \dword{fd}. The most prominent ones are 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generating and transmitting the \SI{600}{\kV} voltage safely to the cathode plane \SI{12}{\m} below the liquid level.
    \item Safely dissipating all the energy stored ($\sim$ \SI{3}{\kJ}) in the %entire 
    \dword{tpc} in the event of an \dword{hv} discharge.
    \item Managing the dissimilar thermal contraction rates of the various component %different 
    materials over the \SI{60}{\m} length of the \dword{tpc}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Requirements}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-des-consid}

The working principle of the \dword{lartpc} relies on applying a strong and  very uniform  \efield in ultra-pure \dword{lar}. A number of detector performance parameters benefit from such an \efield in ways that directly support the core components of the \dword{dune} physics program. \fixme{not sure what prev sentence is saying. I think you could skip from 'ultra-pure Lar.' straight to next pgraph. anne} Some of these are examined in detail in \dword{tdr} Volume~\volnumberphysics{} \voltitlephysics{}. %, the Physics . 
Here we set the context by presenting a qualitative description of the \efield effects on physics.

Since free electron drift velocity in \dword{lar} is a function of the \efield, a uniform \efield allows mapping along the drift direction using simple time versus position and enables precise and efficient \threed reconstruction.  This allows, for example, establishing a well defined fiducial volume for %beam neutrino events reconstructed in the \dword{dpmod}.  
reconstructing beam neutrino events in the \dword{dpmod}. A neutrino \dword{cpv} %violation 
measurement, or mass hierarchy test, %at root 
%basically 
compares normalized spectra for electron and muon neutrino and antineutrino interactions in the fiducial volume of the %\dword{fd}
\dword{dpmod}, as projected from the \dword{nd}. For this reason, fiducial volume characterization is critical.   

Spectral information is necessary to separate \dword{cp} and \dword{mh} effects, necessitating efficient track and shower reconstruction and good energy resolution. Toward these ends, higher \efield strengths are generally better.  More free charge is created at the ionization points because recombination decreases at higher fields, improving \dword{s/n} and calorimetry. Drift times are reduced, resulting in less electron capture and better \dword{s/n}, even under less than optimal purity conditions.  Spatial resolution improves as $\sqrt{t_{drift}}$-dependent diffusion effects decrease. %lessen. 
Higher free charge production and lower electron capture give lower detection thresholds on components of electromagnetic showers, improving shower energy reconstruction.  Lower detection thresholds also lead to higher detection efficiency for MeV-scale electron, photon, and neutron signatures of low-energy $\nu_e$ interactions from \dword{snb} events.  The decreased recombination affects highly ionizing particles, usually protons, more than \dwords{mip}. Less saturation of free charge production occurs, leading to better particle identification and more precise energy measurements. Lower recombination particularly helps proton-kaon separation by $dE/dx$, a key component of a search for $p\rightarrow K^+ \nu$ baryon decay events. 

However, apart from obvious technical limitations, the \efield should not be raised beyond certain limits. For instance, while free charge production increases with \efield, scintillation photon production decreases, resulting in fewer photons available for triggering and establishing $t_{0}$. % purposes.
Two-track separation can degrade if drift velocity is increased while keeping anode wire separation and electronic waveform sampling fixed. The distance between the \dword{tpc} boundaries and the cryostat walls would likely need to be increased for very high \efield{}s to prevent electrostatic discharge. This would, in turn, reduce the fraction of the \dword{lar} within the fiducial volume. The effects of the first \fixme{the first what? is it "fewer photons" first and "two-track separation degradation" second?}  is modest, and all effects are subsumed by technical challenges in delivering \dword{hv} to the cryostat and maintaining highly stable \dword{hv} surfaces for several decades of operation. \fixme{several decades?} These challenges require developing non-commercial cryogenic \dword{hv} feedthroughs, \dword{hv} ripple-repression through custom \dword{hv} RC  circuits, careful construction and deployment of \dword{hv} cables, redundant \dword{hv} connections, high-quality monitoring, and best practices at all stages of design, installation, and operation.

Two decades of design and operational experience that began with ICARUS~\cite{icarus} have established that a \SI{500}{\V/\cm} field is an appropriate trade-off value that can be realistically achieved using cost-effective design and construction methods. Achieving this design goal in the \dword{dpmod} %will be challenging because the drift distance has progressively increased to the \SI{12}{m} foreseen for the \dword{dpmod} (6m drift), and overall detector optimization has proven important. (Anne)
will be challenging because of the \SI{12}{m} drift distance, and the importance of overall detector optimization. 
The forthcoming test of \dword{pddp} will likely run at the nominal \dword{hv} of \SI{-300}{\kV}. Its successful operation will confirm that the \dword{fd}  \dword{dpmod} can operate at least at E=\SI{250}{\V/\cm}. 
However, %DUNE must be able to run at higher voltage,
it must be able to run at an \efield of up to the nominal \SI{500}{\V/\cm} %field 
(\dword{hv} of \SI{-600}{\kV}) to compensate for unexpectedly low purity conditions that could arise over two decades of planned operation. 
\fixme{is the -300 vs +500 significant? I think including the neg sign with 300 just serves to confuse}


%\fixme{(It would be better if we could cite ProtoDUNE)} 
The \SI{500}{\V/\cm} \efield goal, combined with high \dword{lar} purity, a large \dword{s/n} ratio, and a large \dword{crp} gain, will allow a wide range of possible operating points to optimize detector performance

for maximum physics potential over two decades of stable conditions and very high live time. 
%\fixme{some duplications in the paragraph above and below - BY}
This value is therefore set as the goal. 
%The specifications for the \dword{dune} \dword{dp} \dword{hv} system thus have the goal of \SI{500}{\V/\cm}, pointed  toward the highest possible detector performance and widest span of operating points, and a minimum

Unlike the \dword{sp} case, in the \dword{dp} detector space charge could %be non-negligible in distorting the \efield %uniformity 
distort the \efield to a non-negligible degree 
because of the presence of the irreducible $^{39}Ar$ radioactive background that constantly produces positive ions in \dword{lar} and the long drift distance that prolongs their %permanence 
presence in the drift volume. %In addition, this effect could be highly enhanced by the injections into \dword{lar} of the positive ions produced by the electron multiplication in the \dword{lem} amplification stage (up to a factor \num{20} at nominal \dword{lem} gain). 
Injections into \dword{lar} of positive ions produced by the electron multiplication in the \dword{lem} amplification stage (up to a factor \num{20} at nominal \dword{lem} gain) could significantly enhance this effect. 
%To mitigate this effect, the \efield in the drift region must be as high as possible, which allows speeding up positive ions in \dword{lar} toward the cathode where they are neutralized, thus reducing the overall space charge. Hence, the goal of reaching the nominal value of \SI{500}{\V/\cm} is much more important for the \dword{dp} case, in spite of the higher technological challenge of applying \SI{-600}{\kV} on the cathode. 
To reduce the overall space charge, it is necessary to keep the \efield in the drift region as high as possible to drift the positive ions more quickly toward the cathode where they are neutralized. This underlines the importance of reaching the nominal value of \SI{500}{\V/\cm} in the \dword{dpmod} despite the greater challenges. 
%Hence, the goal of reaching the nominal value of \SI{500}{\V/\cm} is much more important for the \dword{dp} case, in spite of the higher technological challenge of applying \SI{-600}{\kV} on the cathode.

The \dword{hv} system is designed to meet the physics requirements of the \dword{dune} experiment. This includes both physical requirements (e.g., an \efield 
that allows robust event reconstruction) and operational requirements (e.g., 
avoiding over-complication to maximize data collection efficiency).

%The \dword{pddp} detector was designed to cover \SI{6}{\m} $\times$ \SI{6}{\m} $\times$ \SI{6}{\m} active volume. This enabled testing the concept of scalable final detector components, in particular the \dword{crp}. the cathode, and the \dword{gp} whose unit component dimensions are \SI{3}{\m} (W) $\times$ \SI{3}{\m} (L). The \dword{fc} of the \dword{pddp} surrounds the \SI{6}{\m} $\times$ \SI{6}{\m} $\times$ \SI{6}{\m} active volume, so the testing was effectively done using the concept that the combination of the \SI{3}{\m} (W) $\times$ \SI{2}{\m} (H) sub-modules make up an \dword{fc} module of dimension \SI{3}{\m} (W) $\times$ \SI{6}{\m} (H). The HV applied to the cathode was at maximum \SI{-300}{\kV} to provide a \SI{500}{\V/\cm} drift field to the \SI{6}{\m} drift length. The sub-module assembly procedure and the subsequent installation procedure were tested in the cryostat and can be applied to \dword{dune} with some minor changes to reflect the lessons learned from \dword{pddp} installation.  
The \dword{pddp} detector has a \SI{6}{\m} $\times$ \SI{6}{\m} $\times$ \SI{6}{\m} active volume.

The \dword{pddp} detector is not yet in operation at the time of this writing, so we can only provide information on the air commissioning (see Section~\ref{sec:fddp-hv-protodune-air}).


\subsection{Design}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-protodune-lessons-design}
%The design of the \dword{pddp} \dword{fc} sub-modules used two \SI{15.2}{\cm} (\SI{6}\,in) FRP I-beams connected by two \SI{7.6}{\cm} (\SI{3}\,in) FRP I-beam cross bars, to form a frame. The two \SI{15.2}{\cm} (\SI{6}\,in) FRP I-beams have slots conforming to the shape of the aluminum profiles in which they are inserted. Since the mechanical connections between the sub-modules use \SI{10}{\cm} wide G10 plates exterior to the active volume as well as the (\SI{3}\,in) FRP I-beam cross bars, a large fraction of insulators from the FRP frame structure is exposed toward the cryostat membrane wall at ground. The design of the \dword{fc} sub-module has been changed to minimize insulator exposure toward the cryostat membrane wall to reduce the potential source for unexpected streamers which were observed in \dword{pdsp} operations.  With this change, the new design for \dword{dune} has no insulators exposed toward the wall, leaving all inter-sub-module mechanical connections inside the active volume, away from the walls. Furthermore, to reduce the drift field distortion from surface charge accumulation, the cross bars are replaced with stainless steel tubes as described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:dp-hv-system-fc}.

The \dword{pddp} \dword{fc} sub-modules consist of two \SI{15.2}{\cm} (\SI{6}\,in) \dword{frp} I-beams connected by two \SI{7.6}{\cm} (\SI{3}\,in) \dword{frp} I-beam cross bars, to form a frame. The two \SI{15.2}{\cm} (\SI{6}\,in) I-beams have slots conforming to the shape of the aluminum profiles in which they are inserted. \fixme{that are inserted in them?} Since the mechanical connections between the sub-modules use \SI{10}{\cm}-wide G10 plates exterior to the active volume as well as the (\SI{3}\,in) I-beam cross bars, a large fraction of the insulators from the \dword{frp} frame structure is exposed toward \fixme{is exposed to? is close to? faces? anne} the cryostat membrane wall, which is at ground. 

The \dword{dpmod} \dword{fc} sub-module design has been changed such that all inter-sub-module mechanical connections are inside the active volume, away from the cryostat walls, to reduce the potential for streamers, which were observed in \dword{pddp}. Furthermore, to reduce the drift field distortion from surface charge accumulation, the cross bars are replaced with stainless steel tubes (see  Section~\ref{sec:dp-hv-system-fc}).

Two \dword{pddp} designs  raised significant concerns about the possibility of discharging a large amount of stored energy toward the membrane wall or the floor:  (1) the aluminum profile electrodes that form an electrically continuous field-shaping ring and that are interconnected with aluminum clips, and (2) the use of stainless steel tubes in the cathode construction. A large  discharge could seriously damage the cryostat wall, virtually disable detector operations and cause a significant safety hazard. 
To address these safety concerns, in \dword{dune} \dword{dp}, the metal profile clips are replaced with resistive sheaths, and the cathode modules are made of resistive tubes held by metal trusses as described in Sections~\ref{sec:dp-hv-system-fc} and ~\ref{sec:dp-hv-system-cathode}, respectively.

The \dword{pddp} resistive HV divider boards shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pddp-hvdb}a-c are designed to provide the desired voltage difference between two adjacent field-shaping rings. 
Most of these boards cover nine gaps. 
The two boards that connect the cathode to the \dword{fc} cover eight  gaps due to %the chose \fixme{choice?} of the 
the total number of field shaping rings. % in \dword{pddp}.
%\fixme{This is not entirely clear because the two types of resistive VHV divider boards are not named. In addition, pairing up the divider boards with the respective gaps would be clearer than using the phrasing necessary to "respectively."  Resistive VHV divider board X is designed to cover \num{9} gaps, and resistive VHV divider board Y is designed to cover \num{8} gaps. See Figure~\ref{fig:pddp-hvdb}.}
The design of the HV divider board called for ample redundancy.  
Each gap between the adjacent field-shaping rings has two \SI{2}{\giga\ohm} main resistors for the voltage drop and four varistors to accommodate up to \SI{6}{\kV}, twice the operation voltage, in case the final \SI{600}{\kV} HV power supply becomes available.
\dword{pddp} uses two rows of \dword{hvdb} for additional redundancy, taking advantage of the electrically continuous field-shaping rings.
The board design will change slightly for the \dword{dpmod} to minimize the potential for a discharge between the solder balls on the back of the board, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pddp-hvdb}c, that are exposed  between the two adjacent field-shaping rings. 
In addition, since the operational voltage difference is \SI{3}{\kV} between the two adjacent profiles, the number of varistors will be reduced from four to two, significantly simplifying the design of the board and potentially eliminating the exposed solder balls.

\subsection{Construction}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-protodune-lessons-construction}
The \dword{pddp} construction process worked out well, so the same process will be followed for the \dword{dpmod}. 
The vendor-machined \dword{frp} parts for the \dword{fc} are processed at the factory to eliminate burrs and defects left on the parts for \dword{qa} and \dword{qc}.   
These parts are then cleaned following a procedure using de-ionized water and colorless simple green \fixme{? anne} and dried in a humidity controlled storage room.
Once the \dword{frp} I-beam parts are dried, the processed surfaces % areas 
are covered with polyurethane varnish for further suppression of remaining fiber on their edges. % of them. 
The parts are then brought to a humidity-controlled cleanroom (class $\sim\,$10,000), assembled as a frame to ensure mechanical fitness, then  disassembled and packaged as a compact package of \SI{0.2}{\m} (W) $\times$ \SI{0.2}{\m} (H) $\times$ \SI{2}{\m} (L), and wrapped in plastic shrink wrap for storage before shipment.
%This process worked out well in \dword{pddp}, so the same process will be followed in \dword{dune} \dual as well.
The design change makes it significantly easier to process and condition the \dword{frp} parts since the \dword{frp} I-beams no longer have slots conforming to the profiles, eliminating the time-consuming machining and cleaning process.
In addition, the size of the package for each sub-module will be considerably more compact than for the \dword{pddp} \dword{fc} sub-modules, since the width of the I-beams are \SI{10.2}{\cm} (\SI{4}\,in).

\end{dunefigure}

The resistor and varistor parts for the \dword{pddp} \dwords{hvdb}are tested in air while warm, in \lntwo, and then again in air after warm up, to ensure the quality and resilience of the parts.  
Based on these measurements, parts are selected to ensure resistance values within \num{1}\% of the mean. 
The selected parts are shipped to the contractor to be mounted on the \dword{pcb} with through holes allowing soldering on the back of the board.
The boards with resistors mounted on them are then tested again for \dword{qc}, twice in air and once in \lntwo, unless any of the gaps fail the \dword{qc} criteria, in which case the board is rejected and sent back to the manufacturer to replace the parts in the failed gap.
The same \dword{qc} process will be used for the \dword{dpmod}.

The \dword{pddp} \SI{3}{\m}$\times$ \SI{3}{\m} cathode units were built out of stainless steel tubes welded together in a structure that ensures over \num{90}\% light transparency.
To slow down energy release from an unexpected discharge in \dword{pddp}, resistor boards were built to interconnect two neighboring cathode units. 
This resistor network, however, affected the input voltage to the \dword{hvdb} row diagonally across the \dword{fc} panel that accepts \dword{hvps} input. The bottom-most gap of the \dword{hvdb} row was then modified to compensate for the voltage drop across the diagonal connection from the \dword{hv} input. 
%This choice to implement resistors, and thus slow down energy release, has been taken into account in \dword{dune} \dual cathode design, as described in Section~\ref{sec:dp-hv-system-cathode}.
The \dword{dpmod} cathode will implement resistors, as described in Section~\ref{sec:dp-hv-system-cathode}.

\subsection{Assembly and Installation}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-protodune-lessons-assy}

The \dword{fc} sub-modules were built in the cleanroom buffer in front of the \dword{tco} of the \dword{pddp} cryostat.
The assembly of each sub-module, including inserting and securing the profiles onto the \dword{frp} frame takes two people approximately two hours.
When as many sub-modules are built as the cleanroom buffer storage space allows, they are brought into the cryostat for installation.
Installing each \SI{6}{\m} (H) $\times$ \SI{3}{\m} (W) full length module begins with hanging the top sub-module to a $\sim$ \SI{3}{\m} stainless steel I-beam attached to the stainless steel cable through \fdth in the ceiling.
The subsequent two sub-modules are then hung onto the top module successively.
The whole installation process for a \SI{6}{\m} module takes four people approximately an hour with two people inside the cryostat connecting the modules while the other two are outside on top of the cryostat roof, operating the winches that raise the corresponding partial module as the successive sub-modules are attached.
This scheme requires two \fdth holes per module, which makes the total number of \dword{fc} installation \fdth holes large.

\begin{dunefigure}[\dual \dword{fc} installation process and inter-module connection]{fig:dp-fc-installation-connection}{Left: Two sub-modules connected and hanging from the two sets of stainless steel cables on the ceiling.  The lifting wires raise the module to its position as sub-modules are connected; the hanging wires keep the fully integrated module in its final position.  Right: Inter-sub-module connections.  Each connection is made with two \SI{1}{cm} thick G10 plates along the height of the I-beams and one \SI{1}{cm} thick G10 plate on the flange.}

\end{dunefigure}

A modified installation plan has been developed to dramatically reduce the number of \fdth holes and reduce the parts needed for the \dword{fc} modules as described in Section~\ref{sec:dp-hv-system-fc}.

The \SI{3}{\m} (L) $\times$ \SI{3}{\m} (W) \dword{pddp} cathode and \dword{gg} modules are preassembled outside of the cleanroom buffer and brought into the cryostat for installation.
The assembly and installation scheme for the \dword{dune} \dword{dp} cathode must also change because its structure and the material composition will be modified to increase dramatically the time for energy release with the final goal of protecting the cryostat.

\subsection{Pre-cooldown Commissioning Test}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-protodune-air}

\fixme{this is what anne understands:}
Once FC was completely installed but before installation of other detector components, you wanted to test the electrical response of the FC and see if you could hold 150kV.  
You made all the connections (using the same equipment and technique as you will when you're ready to connect them for actual operation?). You held the voltage (success), but the current rose too high (not good). Your camera looked for sparks, but you don't say if you saw any. You suspected a surface layer of water on the FRP that the current flows through. So to test, you took a separate piece of FRP, hooked it up and got same result. But it worked fine in LAr.  You still want to investigate the water adhesion properties of FRP from different manufacturers because you don't want this surface current problem to occur even in air.
\fixme{end Anne's blurb. Please correct or confirm my understanding. Once I understand better, I can edit the below better.}


To ensure the performance of the \dword{fc} and to identify any issues well before the final installation of the detector pieces, the \dword{pddp} \dword{fc} was connected to a \SI{150}{\kV} power supply for an ``air commissioning'' test. The entire \dword{fc} was fully installed and connected; slip nuts were used for inter-module connections to provide electrical continuity. 
As these connections were made to each %of the 
field shaping ring, 
\fixme{connections betw rings or modules? anne}
the resistance between \fixme{each set of two?} the two neighboring rings was measured and compared to the expected values for verification of the connection.
The \SI{150}{\kV} \dword{hv} was fed into the two middle field-shaping rings along the field cage. This ensured 
\fixme{this 'set' the voltage diff?} the voltage difference between any two neighboring rings of \SI{3}{\kV} (the operational voltage) when the top most and bottom most rings were connected to the ground on the membrane wall.

An online wide-angle camera was placed on the floor at the corner where the \dword{hv} was fed in to ensure any possible sparks could be seen.
Current and voltage were carefully monitored and recorded to make sure any discharges could be observed and studied.
When the \dword{hv} was turned on for the first time, we observed the current settled after the charge up was about \num{50}\% higher than expected.
Voltage was left on for many hours to monitor the long-term behavior of the \dword{fc}.
The current continually increased to unexpectedly higher values several times %while the testing was carried 
through multiple power cycles.
A systematic test revealed that the size of the current read back was directly proportional to the number of \dword{fc} modules, independent of the magnitude of the current.

This %test pointed in the direction of the \dword{frp} beams, leading 
result led to the hypothesis that due to the ambient humidity %allowed 
a layer of water %to cover 
formed on the surface of the \dword{frp} beams  through which % and 
the current flowed. % through this water layer.

%Resistance measurements of a \SI{50}{\cm} long \SI{15.2}{\cm} (\SI{6}{in}) wide I-beam sample piece in air with similar  humidity and in \dword{lar} showed that while the current in air was consistent with what was observed for \dword{pddp} \dword{fc}, the resistance showed expected values with virtually no surface current flowing through once the \dword{frp} I-beam is in \dword{lar}. Since this behavior was not observed in \dword{pdsp} \dword{fc} which was under the similar humidity environment, we suspect that the \dword{frp} beams from a different manufacturer may have different surface water adhesion properties. Thus, it may be necessary to study the \dword{frp} beam from the current manufacturer in further detail for \dual \dword{fc}.

\section{HV System Design}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-design}

The structural elements of the \dword{dpmod} cathode and \dword{fc} resemble a rectangular wire basket (see Figure~\ref{fig:dune_dp_fd_hvs}). The vertical \dword{fc} members are made of \dword{frp} beams and the horizontal members are stainless steel profiles at graded potentials that surround the \dword{tpc} volume. The cathode (the bottom of the basket) consists of \dword{frp} bars laminated with resistive kapton.  Stainless steel I-beams support the \dword{fc} from above; they are tied together to form a rigid rectangular frame.  

\fixme{Anne still working through this - I think we can make this intro section shorter 4/3/19}

The components that go into the \dword{hvs} are listed in Table~\ref{tab:hvcomponents}. The dimensions are given relative to the \SI{60}{m} length (L), \SI{12}{m} width (W), and \SI{12}{m} height (H) of cryostat.

%Anne replaced this text: For the \dual \dword{fd} \dword{hvs}, we are adopting a concept partially similar to that developed in the \single \dword{tpc} \dword{hv} system design, in which the \dword{fc} is built in independent modules, as much as possible equal to each other. Contrary to the \single case, however, the aluminum profiles mounted in the modules will be electrically connected together through resistive elements to form full 144 m long equi-potential rings surrounding the drift volume.
%\fixme{JY to Bo and Francesco: What concept from \single does the \dual adopting?  Certianly not the electrical isolation between the modules.}
%As in the \dword{sp}  case, the cathode will be made entirely of highly resistive material. However, to make it transparent to the scintillation light detectors placed below the cathode, it will be made of \dword{frp} bars laminated with resistive kapton (similar materials as the ones used for the \single CPA). The implementations for the \dword{fc} and cathode are summarized as follows.
% ---Move to FC subsection. AH --- Similar to the \dword{spmod}, the \dword{dpmod} \dword{fc} is modular, with sections as similar to each other as possible, and the cathode will be made entirely of \dword{frp} laminated with highly resistive kapton. Adjacent aluminum profiles of the \dword{fc} modules will be electrically connected by resistive elements to form the full \SI{144}{m}-long equipotential rings that run the full perimeter of the drift volume. 

%Anne replaced this text: The basic \dword{fc} sub-modules are \SI{2}{\m} high and \SI{4}{\m} wide. We must stack six such sub-modules for a full module covering the \SI{12}{\m} drift length. Three such modules form a super-module and are suspended under one stainless steel I-beam. One row of \dword{hvdb} is mounted to the middle module, interconnecting two adjacent field shaping profiles with \SI{1}{\giga\ohm} resistance in  parallel to surge suppressing varistors to protect the resistors. The profiles in the two neighboring modules at the given height are resistively coupled using a resistive sheath to the one in the center module at the same height, reaching the same bias voltage since no current flows across the given field shaping ring.  Similar resistive interconnects are also made between the profiles across super-modules to provide additional redundancy in the \dword{fc} electrical connection, leveraging the row of \dword{hvdb} in the neighboring super-modules.

% ---Move to FC subsection. AH --- A \dword{fc} sub-module is \SI{2}{\m} high and \SI{4}{\m} wide.  Six sub-modules stack vertically to make a full \SI{12}{\m} high module. Three adjacent modules form a super-module. One row of \dwords{hvdb} mounts to each end of the middle module's profiles. On each side of the middle module, a \SI{1}{\giga\ohm} resistive sheath connects each profile with its same-height counterpart in the side module. Surge suppressing varistors are connected in parallel to protect the resistors. Similar resistive interconnects are made between pairs of  profiles of adjacent super-modules to provide additional redundancy in the \dword{fc} electrical connection, leveraging the row of \dwords{hvdb} in the neighboring super-modules.  The connected profiles reach the same bias voltage since no current flows along the ring that they form.  \fixme{it seems like each end would need its own row of HVDB. I must misunderstand something. Anne}

The \dword{dp} cathode consists of thin bars because it must be effectively transparent for scintillation light to reach the \dwords{pd} below it. 
The basic mechanical and electrical element of the cathode plane is a \SI{12}{\m} long metal truss structure connecting the two \dword{fc} columns \fixme{what's an FC column? A module? An FRP member?} opposite one another across the \dword{tpc} volume.  Two such trusses are linked (resistively) by two metal tubes at the ends, and \num{122} resistive rods (\SI{4}{\m} long) are threaded across the trusses to form the cathode plane.  

% Anne replaced this text: The structural elements of the entire cathode and \dword{fc} resemble a rectangular wire basket (see Figure~\ref{fig:dune_dp_fd_hvs}), with all vertical members made of \dword{frp} beams and all horizontal members made of stainless steel.  The stainless steel I-beams holding the \dword{fc} super-modules are tied together to form a rigid rectangular frame.  During cool down, this top stainless steel frame, and all the stainless steel bracing bars between the \dword{fc} \dword{frp} beams, as well as the entire cathode plane shrink uniformly at the same CTE to ensure the walls of the \dword{fc} move inward uniformly without additional stress.

% Anne is rewriting this to be more positive: Having the cryostat inner length fixed at \SI{62}{\m} and the \dword{crp} length at \SI{60}{\m} leaves the \endwall \dword{fc} clearance to the cryostat wall at well under \SI{1}{\m}.  This is deemed unsafe for the \SI{600}{\kV} operating voltage at the bottom of the \dword{fc}.  To gain additional clearance at the bottom of the \dword{tpc}, the \endwall \dword{fc} super-modules are designed to be pushed into the active volume by \SI{0.5}{\m} at the cathode resulting in a \num{2.4} degree angle from vertical.  The bottom parts of the \endwall super-module are tied to the cathode structure to prevent it from swinging back.  Additional braces at 1/3 and 2/3 of the drift depth to support and maintain the \endwall \dword{fc} at this angle.

% This is covered in the FC section below. Anne. The cryostat inner length dimension is \SI{62}{\m}. To gain a safe clearance  from the cryostat wall at the bottom of the \dword{tpc} where the cathode is at \SI{60}{kV}, the \endwall \dword{fc} super-modules are designed to be installed \SI{0.5}{\m} from the edge of the active volume. The \endwall \dword{fc} will thus be at a \num{2.4} degree angle from vertical.  The bottom parts of the \endwall super-module are tied to the cathode structure to prevent it from swinging back.  Additional braces at 1/3 and 2/3 of the drift depth will support and maintain the \endwall \dword{fc} at this angle.

%The \dword{pdsp} operation revealed some instability in the \dword{hv} system.  The problems appear to be related to surface charge build up on the HVS insulating components. 
The \dword{pdsp} operation revealed some instability in the \dword{hv} system apparently related to surface charge build-up on the \dword{hvs} insulating components. Based on this experience, the \dword{dp} cathode and \dword{fc} structure have been redesigned to eliminate all insulation surfaces outside of the active volume between the \dword{fc} and the cryostat wall.

%\subsection {High Voltage Power Supply, Feedthrough and HV Extender\& Degrader - 4 pages}

\subsection {High Voltage Power Supply and Feedthroughs}
The \dword{hv} delivery system consists of
\begin{itemize}
\item one power supply,
\item \dword{hv} cryogenic \fdth{}s, and
\item an \dword{hv} cryogenic extender, 
\end{itemize}

as listed in Table~\ref{tab:hvcomponents}. To ensure the nominal \efield of \SI{500}{\V/\cm} over  the \dpmaxdrift drift distance, an external power supply must deliver \dptargetdriftvoltneg to  the cathode through one \dword{hv} cryogenic \fdth, with a maximum current draw of \SI{0.5}{\milli\ampere}.
At present, such a power supply does not exist, but  Heinzinger, the industrial partner and leader in producing \dword{hv} power supplies, is executing a vigorous R\&D program toward this goal, relying on the following facts:

\begin{itemize}
\item \dptargetdriftvoltpos power supplies are feasible, scaling the present industrial technology;
\item the same is possibly true for the \dword{hv} cryogenic \fdth, scaling to larger diameter and longer length than the present \SI{300}{\kV} prototypes; and 
\item the critical points of the \dword{hv} distribution are then the cable and its connectors on the power supply and on the \dword{hv}{} \fdth. 
\end{itemize}

The joint R\&D program between \dword{dune} and Heinzinger aims to eliminate cables and connectors, building a power supply that can be connected directly on the top of the \dword{hv}{} \fdth.  A sample schematic and some details are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dune-dp-hvps-ft}. 
Heinzinger is further motivated to pursue this because of possible new industrial applications.

\begin{dunefigure}[HV power supply and \fdth for a \dpmod ]

\fixme{I added hdpe, hvps to glossary. Authors need to define them there please! anne}

Typical Heinzinger power supplies have ripples in the range of $\sim$\SI{30}{k\hertz} with an amplitude of \SI{0.001}{\%V_{nom}} $\pm$ \SI{50}{mV}. A low-pass RC filter designed to reduce the voltage ripple could be integrated into the output of the power supply.  It should be noted, however, that the required ripple suppression need not be as high as for the \dword{spmod} because the \dword{dpmod} has more effective shielding of the anodic structure, performed by the extraction grid and by the \dword{crp} signal amplification stage. 

%Assuming the distance between the power supply and the cathode to be \SI{15}{\m} and the capacitance of the \fdth and \dword{hv} extender to be about \SI{100}{\pF/\m}, a resistance of a few M$\Omega$ integrated at the output of the power supply is sufficient for noise reduction.

The \dword{hv} \fdth is based on the same successful ICARUS design adopted in both \dword{pdsp} and \dword{pddp}.  In this design, the voltage is transmitted along a stainless steel center conductor on the warm exterior of the cryostat, where this conductor mates with a cable end.  Inside the cryostat, the end of the center conductor has a spring-loaded tip that  contacts a receptacle cup mounted on the cathode, from which point \dword{hv} is delivered to the \dword{fc}.  The center conductor of the \fdth is surrounded by \dword{uhmwpe}.  


To first order, the upper bound of operating voltage on a \fdth is set by the maximum \efield on the \fdth.  Increasing the insulator radius reduces the \efield.  For the target voltage, the \fdth uses a \dword{uhmwpe} cylinder of at least \SI{15.2}{\cm} (\SI{6}\,in) diameter.  In the gas space and into at least \SI{15.2}{\cm} of the liquid, a tight-fitting stainless steel ground tube surrounds the insulator.  The ground tube has a Conflat~\footnote{Conflat\texttrademark{}, \url{https://www.lesker.com/newweb/flanges/flanges_technicalnotes_conflat_1.cfm}.} flange of at least \SI{25.4}{\cm} (\SI{10}\,in) in diameter welded on for attachment to the cryostat.

A prototype \fdth \footnote{The prototype was manufactured by the company CINEL\texttrademark{} Strumenti Scientifici Srl.}  has been successfully tested up to \SI{-300}{\kV} in pure argon in a dedicated setup; two similar prototypes are %being 
installed in \dword{pdsp} and \dword{pddp}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{High Voltage Extender and Voltage Degrader}

Since the \dword{hv} must be guided from the top of the cryostat to the cathode (\SI{12}{\m} below the \dword{lar} surface), an extension of the \dword{hv} \fdth is required, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dp-hvft-extender} a, b, and c. The extender contains an inner conductor at \dptargetdriftvoltneg surrounded by an insulator. The extension runs the entire height of the drift volume, so metallic rings (degrader rings) are installed on the periphery of the extension close to the field-shaping ring. Each degrader ring is electrically connected to the field-shaping ring at the same height thus guaranteeing that the \efield in the \lar between the extender and the \dword{fc} remains at \SI{0}{V/cm}. As an alternative, equipping the extender with an independent voltage degrader is under evaluation. This would have the advantage of eliminating the large %amount 
number of connecting strips to the \dword{fc} profiles; on the other hand,  it would  require an independent path to ground.

% \SI{12}{\m} (W) $\times$ \SI{12}{\m} (H) $\times$ \SI{60}{\m} (L) 
drift volume and provides a constant potential surface at \dptargetdriftvoltneg{}.  It receives its \dword{hv} from the central conductor of the HV extender that carries the voltage from the power supply through the \dword{hv} \fdth.  

The cathode plane consists of fifteen adjacent \SI{4}{\m} $\times$ \SI{12}{\m} unit modules to cover the \SI{60}{\m} length of the \dword{dp} \dword{tpc}. 
The cathode module design is based on the design used in \dword{pddp}, with modifications to %reach 
accommodate the \SI{12}{\m} span of the \dword{dpmod} and to implement features to electrically segment the cathode plane.

As shown in  Figure~\ref{fig:dune-dp-cathode}, each cathode module is constructed from two \SI{12}{\m} long trusses made from thin walled stainless steel tubes with approximately \SI{50}{\mm} outer diameter.  They can either be prefabricated and transported underground like the large cryostat beams, or assembled in the underground clean room from sectional parts. \fixme{The DP IIC chapter should address this.

Preliminary mechanical analysis of the design shows that the deflection of the structure is approximately \SI{4}{\cm} when warm and approximately \num{60}\% of that when in \dword{lar} (Figure~\ref{fig:dune-dp-cathode-deflection}).  The cathode modules are suspended %to the matching

An \dword{hv} bus, made from \dword{hv} cable segments, is threaded through the outer tube ring that is formed once the full set of cathode modules are in place to form a conductive ring that distributes the cathode bias voltage.  The mounting plates (shown in gold in Figure~\ref{fig:dune-dp-cathode}) at both ends of a cathode truss are directly connected to the \dword{hv} bus via metal rings inside the tube.  These mounting plates are also connected to the \dword{fc} resistive divider chains. Between the mounting plate and the %cyan colored 
truss, a layer of resistive sheet provides an additional barrier to energy transfer.  The resistivity of this sheet will be chosen to ensure the ionization current from \Ar39 activities \fixme{activity?} and the ion feedback from the \dword{lem} multiplication will not cause significant voltage drop on the cathode.

%\fixme{JY to Bo and Francesco: I calculate 1.08kJ not 1,7kJ.

If we use the ground grid which has even smaller gap size, this value is even larger.  The 1.7kJ is also inconsistent with the energy stored under teach of the cathode unit later in the section.}

%A sudden discharge from the cathode to the cryostat membrane could cause severe damage to both.  ------Anne rewording to emphasize safety ---
The modular construction of the cathode minimizes potential damage to either or both components in the case of a sudden discharge from the cathode to the cryostat membrane.
%The modular construction of the cathode helps minimize this effect in case of discharge. The cathode plane's structural elements (trusses) are metallic, spanning the 12m width of the TPC.  However, in the 60m direction, 
Along the \SI{60}{m} length of the \dword{dpmod} the trusses and their interconnecting metal tubes are %all 
coupled with highly resistive unions (on the order of \si{\giga\ohm}), %.  The resistive elements are 
designed to restrict the flow of current from %the 
any potential discharge site.    
%%During assembly in the cryostat, the cathode units are kept electrically insulated. Each unit is then connected to their immediately adjacent neighbors through resistive tubular elements with value of the order of the \si{\giga\ohm}  
%\fixme{JY to Bo and Francesco: I have no idea what this particular sentence is trying to say.  If the neighboring cathode planes are connected through a \si{\giga\ohm} resisters - one or two? and how? - they are not insulated from each other.  Is this trying to say that the cathode units are connected with each other only through these resisters that connects the frames?  Don't we need some description as to how we envision doing this?  The description for this inter-cathode unit module connected is quite imbalanced compared to the structure of each unit.} 

%Dividing the \SI{1.7}{\kilo\joule} of energy evenly among the \num{15} cathode modules, each has about \SI{110}{\joule}.  On a cathode module, each truss has about 1/8 of this energy, while the resistive rods share the remaining 3/4. A worst case discharge is from a cathode truss, where $\sim$\SI{15}{\joule} is directly available to contribute, and the rest of the \SI{95}{\joule} arrives with a few milliseconds time constant.  The energy transfer from other cathode and field cage modules must pass through \si{\giga\ohm} of resistive connections and therefore will have time constants of the order of a second.
Assuming that the \SI{1.7}{\kilo\joule} of energy is stored evenly among the \num{15} cathode modules, each stores about \SI{110}{\joule}.  On a cathode module, each truss stores about an eighth of this energy, while the resistive rods share the remaining three quarters. \fixme{and the last eighth?} A worst-case discharge would come from a cathode truss, where $\sim$\SI{15}{\joule} is directly available to contribute, with the remaining \SI{95}{\joule} arriving within a time constant of a few milliseconds.  The energy transfer from other cathode and \dword{fc} modules must pass through \si{\giga\ohm}s of resistive connections and therefore will have time constants on the order of a second.

%% while the discharge rate to the other units is slowed to the several-hundred-millisecond range.

Detailed calculations are in progress to determine the final shape and the size of the cathode and \dword{gg} frames to %meet the requirement that 
limit the maximum \efield to \SI{30}{\kV\per\cm}  
throughout the \dword{lar} volume (Figure~\ref{fig:dune-dp-cathode-field}) (see Requirement 2 in Table~\ref{tab:hvphysicsreqs}), and to correct the non-uniformity of drift field at the at the edges of the cathode (see Figure~\ref{fig:dune-dp-cathode-field-2D}).  Structural calculations must also verify the planarity of the cathode as it hangs on the \dword{fc} supports.
Values and voltage characteristics of the connecting resistors will also be defined based on the results of dedicated simulations of the cathode electrical model.


\subsection{Ground Grid}
\label{sec:dp-hv-groundgrid}

An array of \dword{gg} modules \fixme{JY: We should define the dimension of GG unit.  AH: agreed!! 2.72 m square? with gap between gg's of 3.06-2.72=.34m? This doesn't seem right... the next paragraph is unclear.} 
is installed between the \dwords{pmt} and the cathode plane to provide a low \efield environment for the \dwords{pmt} and shield them from an \fixme{a potential?} \dword{hv} discharge from the cathode plane.

A \dword{gg} unit module, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dp-hv-ground-grid}, is made from  stainless steel (\dword{aisi} Type 304) tubes

The \num{4} legs for each \dword{gg} unit module are \SI{2.72}{\m} apart, taking into account the \SI{0.34}{\m} pitch of the membrane corrugation so that the feet are always on the flat part of the membrane. To avoid damage to the membrane floor, the feet will be covered with a Teflon\texttrademark{} %\fixme{Should this have the copyright mark?} 
sheet, which will %make the \dword{gg} unit modules 
electrically isolate them from the membrane cryostat.  The modules are not physically in contact with each other, %which means they

%\fixme{JY: But they are in electrical contact with teach other through the ground on the cryostat floor.  So how would you envision reading them out individually unless the legs are electrically isolated from the GG plane?}.

The maximum \efield is under the curved section of the lower truss member at the \SI{30}{\kV/\cm} limit.

\subsection{Field Cage}
\label{sec:dp-hv-system-fc}


Similar to the \dword{sp} \dword{fc}, the \dword{dp} \dword{fc} is modular; it is broken down into super-modules, modules and sub-modules, as listed in Table~\ref{tab:hvcomponents}.  
Since the \efield must be vertical, the \dword{fc}'s equipotenial conductors, called field-shaping rings, run horizontally around the perimeter of the active volume. The conductors are extruded aluminum open profiles. %These rings are formed by connecting together \dword{fc} modules that contain the extruded aluminum open profiles that are sections of the rings. 

Profile sections are arranged into \dword{fc} sub-modules.
%are electrically connected by resistive elements to form the full \SI{144}{m}-long equipotential rings that run the full perimeter of the drift volume. 
A \dword{fc} sub-module is \SI{2}{\m} high and \SI{4}{\m} wide \fixme{and has how many profiles in it?}.  Six sub-modules stack vertically to make a full \SI{12}{\m} high module. Three adjacent modules form a super-module. One row of \dwords{hvdb} mounts to each end of the middle module's profiles. On each side of the middle module, a \SI{1}{\giga\ohm} resistive sheath connects each profile with its same-height counterpart in the side module. Surge suppressing varistors are connected in parallel to protect the resistors. Similar resistive interconnects are made between pairs of  profiles of adjacent super-modules to provide additional redundancy in the \dword{fc} electrical connection, leveraging the row of \dwords{hvdb} in the neighboring super-modules.  The connected profiles reach the same bias voltage since no current flows along the ring that they form.  \fixme{it seems like each end would need its own row of HVDB. I must misunderstand something. Anne}

  
The profiles at the same height in adjacent modules are interconnected horizontally through resistive sheaths. All the same-height profiles form a closed, electrically continuous rectangular ring. 
The four walls surrounding the \dword{tpc}'s active volume are formed using \num{199} of these rings stacked vertically in \SI{6}{\cm} pitch. The aluminum profiles are attached to structural elements made of pultruded \dword{frp}). \fixme{are these structural elements the "columns"?} 
%\fixme{This abbreviation is used frequently in this chapter, but it is not in the common glossary. It probably should be.}

\dword{frp} is non-conductive and strong enough to withstand the \dword{fc} loads. %in the temperature range of \SI{-150}{\degreeCelsius} to \SI{23}{\degreeCelsius}.
This material meets the  Class A International Building Code classification for flame spread and smoke development, as characterized by ASTM E84\footnote{\url{https://www.astm.org/DATABASE.CART/HISTORICAL/E84-07.htm}}. 

The entire \dword{fc} is constructed from \num{12} super-modules with nominal dimensions of \SI{12}{\m} width and \SI{12}{\m} height. There are \num{5} super-modules along each long side wall, and one each along the short \endwall{}s.  
The cryostat inner length dimension is \SI{62}{\m}. To gain a safe clearance  from the cryostat wall at the bottom of the \dword{tpc} where the cathode is at \SI{-600}{kV}, the \endwall \dword{fc} super-modules are designed to be installed \SI{0.5}{\m} from the edge of the active volume. 
%The \endwall super modules are tilted at \num{2.4} degrees with respect to the vertical to allow \SI{0.5}{\m} additional clearance at the bottom of the \dword{fc} where the voltage is at \SI{-600}{\kV}. 
At the top, the inner surfaces of the \dword{fc} profiles are positioned \SI{15}{\cm} away from the \dword{crp}s' active area to allow the \dword{fc} support structure to pass through and to provide a uniform drift field. For the tilted \endwall super-modules, this \SI{15}{\cm} offset applies only to their top edges due to the \num{2.4} degree tilt. Each super-module, including their top stainless steel beam, weighs about \SI{1200}{\kg}.

%copied from earlier section
%The cryostat inner length dimension is \SI{62}{\m}. To gain a safe clearance  from the cryostat wall at the bottom of the \dword{tpc} where the cathode is at \SI{-600}{kV}, the \endwall \dword{fc} super-modules are designed to be installed \SI{0.5}{\m} from the edge of the active volume. The \endwall \dword{fc} will thus be at a \num{2.4} degree angle from vertical.  The bottom parts of the \endwall super-module are tied to the cathode structure to prevent it from swinging back.  Additional braces at 1/3 and 2/3 of the drift depth will support and maintain the \endwall \dword{fc} at this angle.

Each super-module is built from three \SI{4}{\m}(W)$\times$\SI{12}{m}(H) modules each of which are made of six \SI{4}{\m}(W)$\times$ $\sim$\SI{2}{m}(H) sub-modules. All sub-modules share the same basic construction: two \SI{10}{\cm} (H) $\times$ \SI{5}{\cm} (W) \dword{frp} I-beams with two stainless steel cross bars that form a rigid frame structure as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dune-dp-fc-module}. 
Extruded aluminum profiles of \SI{4}{\m} length are mounted at \SI{6}{\cm} pitch on one side of the \dword{frp} I-beams using screws and slip nuts inside the profiles as can be seen in the photo in Figure~\ref{fig:dune-dp-fc-module} top right inset. Most of the sub-modules are \SI{4}{\m} (W) $\times$ \SI{1.98}{\m} (H). Figure~\ref{fig:dune-dp-fc-module} shows the design of a non-corner \dword{fc} sub-module. 

\fixme{add the reflector panels to the table? Is PDS consortium responsible for them? Anne}
The \dual \dword{pds} has designed \dword{tpb} coated reflector/\dword{wls} panels to be installed on the top half of the \dword{fc} inner surfaces in order to enhance the light collection and to improve the \dword{pd} response uniformity throughout the entire %\dword{tpc} 
active volume as described in Section~\ref{sec:dppd-wls}. The dimension of a reflector/\dword{wls} unit panel assembly to be mounted on the \dword{frp} I-beams of the \dword{fc} sub-modules is \SI{199}{\cm} (W) $\times$ \SI{186}{\cm} (H). The reflector/\dword{wls} panel assembly at the inter-super-module areas will have special extended assemblies to accommodate the \num{2.4} degree tilt of the end walls: 
 \SI{260}{\cm} (W) $\times$ \SI{186}{\cm} (H) for the corner side wall \dword{fc} sub-modules %to accommodate the \num{2.4} degree tilt of the end walls, 
 and \SI{290}{\cm} (W) $\times$ \SI{186}{\cm} (H) for all other \dword{fc} sub-modules at the intersection of two \dword{fc} super-modules. The reflector/\dword{wls} unit module will be mounted on the \dword{frp} I-beams of the \dword{fc} sub-modules with six screws. The details of the reflector/\dword{wls} panel assembly design can be found in Sections \ref{sec:dppd-wls} and \ref{sec:dp-pds-mechanics}.

The extruded aluminum profiles are mounted on the cryostat-wall-side surface of the flange of the \SI{10.2}{\cm} (\SI{4}{in}) \dword{frp} I-beam via two stainless steel screws and aluminum slip nuts in the center enforcement rail of the profile, as can be seen in  Figure~\ref{fig:dune-dp-fc-module}, bottom right inset. The mounting is secured fully  on one of the \SI{10.2}{\cm} I-beams flanges and more loosely on the other, but sufficient %ly secured 
to hold the profile in place. This prevents the contraction on either side of the profile from straining itself. %the profile. 
The top sub-module has an extended \SI{10.2}{\cm} \dword{frp} beam with holes to connect it to the stainless steel I-beam hanging from the ceiling. Each of the \dword{frp} I-beams of the bottom sub-module has a cutout to hold the cathode plane onto it. The four middle sub-modules are symmetric along the height and identical, and thus interchangeable.


The corner sub-modules have similar construction, but with features specific to their locations. On an \endwall super-module, the corner modules have $\SI{90}{^{circ}}$-bent profiles one side. Along the walls running the length of the cryostat, the modules near the \endwall{}s have profiles cut at different lengths to accommodate the \num{2.4} degree incline of the \endwall super-modules.

The \endwall \dword{fc} modules %also 
have a slightly larger pitch between the \dword{fc} profiles to ensure proper alignment when tilted at the designed angle, and are therefore  %.  These profiles are also 
mounted with a slight angle against the \dword{frp} I-beams by means of tapered spacers. % to compensate for the tilt angle.


Approximately \SI{500}{\N} of force is needed to keep the \endwall \dword{fc} super-modules inclined. This force is transferred through the interconnected cathode outer tubes to keep the %opposite \endwall super-module inclined in a symmetrical pattern. 
two \endwall{}s symmetrical. There will be a few centimeters of sag in the middle of the \endwall{}s, which will not affect the \dword{tpc} operation.   

%The \dword{fc} is modular, each module covering a vertical area of \SI{4}{\m} (W) $\times$ \tpcheight (H). 
%There are two types of modules, straight section and corner, both types having the dimensions \SI{4}{\m} (W) $\times$ \tpcheight (H). A total of \num{76} straight section modules (i.e., with straight profiles) and four corner section modules, with profiles bent \num{90} degrees at one corner to allow straight connections via resistive sheaths around the corner on the straight section on the SWSM, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dune-dp-fc-all}.c.  A photo of the \dword{pddp} \dword{fc} is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dune-dp-fc-all}.d.

Each \SI{12}{\m} module has one top sub-module with \num{33} profiles, four middle sub-modules with \num{33} profiles each, and one bottom sub-module with \num{34} profiles, for a total of \num{199} profiles per module. 
The nominal voltage of the top-most field shaping ring is \SI{-9}{\kV}. 
The top sub-module makes the mechanical connection to the ceiling of the cryostat from which the entire \dword{fc} hangs, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dp-fc-installation-connection} left. The bottom modules make both mechanical and electrical connections to the cathode as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:dp-fc-installation-connection} right.


\subsection{Electrical Interconnections}

%A railed rib runs along the length of the aluminum profiles at the center of the profile.  The rib provides mechanical strength and acts as the rail for the slip nuts that hold the profiles onto the supporting \dword{frp} frame. The rib also serves as a rail for the square nuts that hold the \dword{hv} divider boards for both mechanical and electrical connections, and the nuts for securing the resistive sheath whose CAD drawing is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:resistive-sheath} a. 
A rib runs down the center of each aluminum profile to provide mechanical strength and act as a rail for the slip nuts that hold the profile onto the supporting \dword{frp} frame. The rib also serves as a rail for the square nuts that hold the \dword{hv} divider boards for both mechanical and electrical connections, and the nuts for securing the resistive sheath (see  Figure~\ref{fig:resistive-sheath} a). 
%All profiles at a given height are electrically connected via a resistive sheath screwed onto the nut in the center railed rib across each set of two neighboring profiles as shown in the photos in Figure~\ref{fig:resistive-sheath} b and c with a 3D printed mock up plastic sheath with a profile inserted and screwed onto the sheath with a metal screw for a secure electrical connection. 
The set of all profiles at a given height are electrically connected together, end to end. Each neighboring pair is connected via a resistive sheath screwed onto the nuts in the center ribs across the two profiles, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:resistive-sheath} b and c. These images show a \threed{}-printed mock up plastic sheath with a profile inserted and connected to it using metal screws to allow  electrical conduction. 

\begin{dunefigure}[\dual \dword{fc} Resistive Sheath]{fig:resistive-sheath}

\end{dunefigure}

The resistive chain for voltage division between the profiles provides a linear voltage gradient between the cathode and the top-most field shaping ring. This chain is critical because it determines the strength of the \efield between one profile and its neighbors as well as between the profile and other surrounding parts like the grounded stainless steel cryostat membrane. 
The \efield must be kept well below \SI{30}{\kV\per\cm} at all points in the \lar bath to keep \dword{tpc} operation safe, as listed in Table~\ref{}. % the requirement table.

Each stage of the \dword{hvdb} consists of two \SI{5}{\giga\ohm} resistors in parallel for inter-board redundancy and two variable resistors of threshold voltage \SI{2}{kV} to protect the resistors in case of a sudden discharge.  With \num{199} stages under \SI{600}{kV} potential, the total expected current at \dptargetdriftvoltpos is therefore \SI{1.2}{\micro\ampere} per row pf \dword{hvdb}.  
A total of \num{12} rows, one per super-module, connected in parallel, will be employed for  ample redundancy in the \dword{dpmod}, yielding an expected overall current in the %entire 
\dword{fc} system of \SI{14.3}{\micro\ampere}.
For optimization, one \dword{hvdb} will connect \num{11} stages.  %This means  one \tpcheight tall module can be covered by eighteen \num{11} stage \dword{hvdb} and one \num{1} stage \dword{hvdb} at the bottom to make the final connection between the bottom most field-shaping ring and the cathode.
Thus eighteen \num{11}-stage \dwords{hvdb} are required for one \tpcheight tall module  and one \num{1}-stage \dword{hvdb} is required at the bottom to make the final connection between the bottom-most field-shaping ring and the cathode.


Figure~\ref{fig:pddp-hvdb} shows one \dword{pddp} \dword{hvdb} board and  Figure~\ref{fig:dune-dp-fc-all}(d) shows the connection of one row of \dwords{hvdb} strung vertically along the entire height of the \dword{fc} as installed in \dword{pddp}. %The \dptpcwdth (W) $\times$ \dptpclen (L) ground plane consists of \num{80} unit planes (each \SI{3}{\m} $\times$ \SI{3}{\m}).  
The cathode plane is mounted to the bottom of the \dword{fc}, together forming one contiguous unit of field-providing structure.  The bottom-most %one stage 
\dword{hvdb} makes the connection between the cathode and the bottom-most field-shaping ring.
%As discussed above, \dpmod will install one \dword{hvdb} row for each super-module, employing a total of 12 rows, providing additional redundancy.  


\subsection{HV Return and Monitoring Devices}

To maintain the potential difference between the top-most field-shaping ring and the extraction grid of the \dword{crp}, either a dedicated \dword{hv} supply or an adjustable resistor chain will be used in the \dword{hv} return outside  the cryostat. %\fixme{The previous sentence needs some clarification. "Either" requires an "or", but in this sentence, we have either/and. Do you need both the HV supply and the resistor chain? Or is it one or the other, but not both?}  
This requires an independent \SI{10}{kV} \fdth similar to those developed for the extraction grid.

Several devices will monitor the \dword{hv}:  
\begin{itemize}
\item The Heinzinger units have typical sensitivities down to tens of nanoamperes with current readback capability.  The units can sample the current and voltage every few \SI{100}{\milli\s}.  
\item Inside the cryostat, so-called pick-off points near the anode will monitor the current through the \dword{hvdb} resistor chain. Additional pick-off points could be implemented on the \dword{gg} below the cathode to monitor possible stray currents.
\end{itemize}


\section{Quality Assurance and Quality Control}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-qa}

\subsection{Field Cage}

%When \dword{frp} I-beams and other parts are delivered, they all undergo a visual inspection to look for defects, in particular those affecting structural integrity, such as cracks, air bubble holes, depression, and flatness. The parts are sorted into three preliminary categories: category 0 (pass), category 1 (problematic but repairable), and category 2 (severe and unusable).
Upon receipt, \dword{frp} I-beams and other parts undergo a visual inspection for defects, in particular those affecting structural integrity, such as cracks, air bubble holes, depressions, and variations from flatness. The parts are sorted into three preliminary categories: category 0 (pass), category 1 (problematic but repairable), and category 2 (severe and unusable).

The visual inspection is followed by critical dimension measurements to verify individual sub-module assembly and module interconnection integrity.  These measurements focus on cross sectional dimensions for rods, plates, and bars, as well as length, straightness, flatness, and camber of the beams and flanges.
All measurements must satisfy the mechanical tolerances provided by the design drawings and the standard industry quality criteria.

The \dword{frp} I-beams and parts in category 1 undergo a repair process during the preparation stage through defibering, deburring, and sanding.  Another set of measurements is performed after the repair to redetermine the part's category.

Those in category 2 are returned to the vendor for replacement.

All \dword{frp} parts that pass inspection are prepared for use, which involves \dword{qc} at each step.  Each part is first defibered, deburred, sanded to smooth the edges, then varnished to
suppress any remaining fibers. \fixme{wait, this was only done on category 1. Sounds like it's done or redone on all. Anne} Once the part is prepared, it is stored in a humidity- and temperature-controlled drying area for \numrange{24}{48} hours to fully cure the varnish.  After full curing, each module is laser-engraved with a unique part number and recorded in a \dword{qc}  database. \fixme{coordinate with IIC chapter for DP volume. Anne}

At this point, the sub-module is pre-assembled on a table before packaging to ensure all parts fit, including inserts, screws, and slip nuts.   When fitness is verified, the sub-module is disassembled, and all components are packed along with  \numrange{10}{20}\% spare hardware to ensure that each package is self-sufficient for final assembly. It is shrink-wrapped into a compact package of dimensions \SI{10}{\cm} $\times$ \SI{10}{\cm} $\times$ \SI{2}{\m}  and the edges are wrapped with thick plastic sheets to protect the parts from %mechanical damage from falls or other accidents. 
potential mechanical damage. %This package will contain all necessary parts to assemble the given sub-module and \numrange{10}{20}\% spare hardware.  This ensures that each package is self-sufficient for final assembly.  
Each package is given a sub-module number for further tracking.  This sub-module number stays with it throughout assembly at \dword{surf} and final installation, so that the sub-module can be assigned to a specific module, and checked and recorded once it is installed in the module.

\subsection{Electrical Interconnections and HV Divider}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-prod-interconnect}

All resistors used for \dword{hvdb} production are numbered and undergo a three-stage %\dword{qa} 
\dword{qc} test for final selection. Resistance is measured at voltages up to \SI{4}{kV} in \SI{500}{V} steps for each stage. The first stage of testing is done at room temperature, the second in \lntwo, and the third again at room temperature after warming up.  The measured values are histogrammed for final selection to look for groupings of resistance values.   

It is more important that the resistance values be close to each other than that they be at any particular value (unless they are too far from the design values). The resistors for which the resistance values are within 1\%  of each other are selected.%   \fixme{I reworded the prev paragraph}

All varistors for board production are also numbered for \dword{qa} purposes and undergo a three-stage \dword{qa} 
\fixme{are we sure this is QA not QC?}
testing program for the final selection. Each test stage is a clamping voltage measurement, first at room temperature, then at \lntwo temperature, and again after warming back up to room temperature. The measured values are histogrammed for final selection; those with closest clamping voltage to the design values are selected to ensure proper protection.

Once the parts are selected, they are sent over to the vendor for mounting.  When the completed \dwords{hvdb} are delivered, they undergo a three-stage \dword{qa} testing program. Each stage involves a resistance measurement of the whole board and each stage of the board, first at room temperature, then in LN2, and again after warming back up to room temperature.  The measured resistance values are histogrammed for the final board selection. 
The boards can fall into one of three categories: 0 Pass, 1 Repairable, and 2 Rejected. 
\fixme{can we make this the same as above? 0 (pass), category 1 (problematic but repairable), and category 2 (severe and unusable).}
If at any testing stage the resistance is more than \SI{0.5}{\%} away from the mean, the part does not fall into category 0. %Boards in category 1 are sent back to the vendor with the selected resistors, so the parts in failed stages can be replaced with the resistors selected during the QA. 
Boards in category 1 are sent back to the vendor with the selected resistors, so that the parts that failed one stage or another can be replaced with resistors selected during the \dword{qa}. \fixme{QC?}

{\bf Aluminum Profiles and Resistive Sheath:}
The \dword{qa} testing of the aluminum profiles and the resistive sheath is done on prototype production samples before full production begins.   The samples are visually inspected for shape and adherence to the design drawing and for surface smoothness, surface-coating quality, and smoothness of the bend (for profiles with the \num{90}$^{\circ}$ bend).  

The resistive sheath samples are visually inspected for shape and adherence to the drawing, for edge smoothness, resistance and mechanical fitness, as well as for how tightly they fit to the profiles while still allowing %an easy slide to couple 
easy coupling to the neighboring profile and good electrical contact.
Each sheath is numbered and undergoes %an identical 
a three-stage \dword{qa} test for final selection, %as for

\item Acceptance of a setting for the trip-threshold current:  %at this threshold, the software would reduce the voltage output. 
at this point the supply must reduce the voltage output. 
(In previous experiments, the trip function in software would set the output to \SI{0}{kV}.)

\section{Safety}
In all phases of \dword{hv} system deployment of the \dpmod, including fabrication, installation, and operations, safety is the highest priority.  As was done for \dword{pddp}, all assembly, testing, transport, and installation procedures will be documented. Explicit attention is paid to how well \dword{pddp} procedures transfer to the \dpmod. The most critical of these are noted in the preliminary \dword{hv} risk assessment. \fixme{add reference}

\subsection{Handling Safety}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-transport-safety}
%\subsection{Assembly and Installation}
%\label{sec:fddp-hv-install}

The structural and electrical designs for the \dword{dp} \dword{hv} system are based on designs that have been  vetted and validated in \dword{pddp} construction, which %is currently 
as of April 2019 is in its final phase of deployment at \dword{cern}. In parallel with the \dword{pddp} construction and operation, \dword{hv} tests at \dword{cern} are in progress using full-voltage and a full-scale \dword{hv} \fdth, power supply, and monitoring system in dedicated \dword{hv} test facilities. This has also provided an opportunity to complete full safety reviews. 

Operating the \dword{fc} at its full %operating 
voltage produces a substantial amount of stored energy. The modular design of the cathode specifically addresses this safety concern: in the event of a power supply trip or other failure that unexpectedly drops the \dword{hv}, %the charge stored in the segmented cathode structure limits the power dissipated. 
segmented cathode structure prohibits the stored charge from crossing to neighboring cathode modules, thus limiting the power dissipated. \fixme{please check my rewrite above. anne}
%This design will be tested in \dword{pddp} at \SI{300}{kV} voltage over \SI{9}{\m$^2$} surface segmented in each of the four cathode modules.  
This feature of the design will be tested in \dword{pddp} at \SI{300}{kV} over a \SI{9}{\m$^2$} cathode surface segmented into four cathode modules. 

Integral to the \dword{dp} \dword{fc} design, both in \dword{pddp} and the \dword{dpmod}, %is the concept of

The structural design and installation procedures used in \dword{pddp} were %selected 
developed as prototypes for use  %to be compatible with use 
at the \dword{fd} site and were vetted by project engineers, engineering design review teams, and \dword{cern}'s safety engineers. Some revisions to these designs are expected based on lessons learned in \dword{pddp} installation and operations. These revisions will be reviewed both within the \dword{dune} project and by \dword{fnal} \dword{esh} personnel. The attention paid up-front  to %safety 
potential hazards, personnel preparation, and use of equipment puts the  overall \dword{dpmod} \dword{hv} design 
on solid footing in terms of safety. \fixme{check my edits above. anne}

Assembly of the \dword{fc} sub-modules and %resistor-divider boards 
\dwords{hvdb} involves labor from the collaboration members, technical staff, and students, and  does not present unusual industrial hazards. The \dword{hv} consortium will work closely with each assembly site 
\fixme{different from production site?} to ensure that procedures meet both \fnal{}'s and institutional requirements for safe procedures, personal protective equipment, environmental protection, %trained 
materials handling, and training. Most %production 
part fabrication will be done commercially and shipping will be contracted through approved commercial shipping companies. Before a site is approved as a production venue, an external safety panel will visit the site for review to ensure best practices are in place and followed.

\section{Transport, Assembly, and Installation and Integration}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-transport}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Transport and Handling }
\label{sec:fddp-hv-transport-transport}

The \dword{fc} \dword{frp} I-beams, the stainless steel cross bar tubes, and other parts are shipped in standard wooden crates.  Parts for each sub-module are packed into one compact flat pack of \SI{0.1}{\m} $\times$ \SI{0.1}{\m} $\times$ \SI{2}{\m} sealed in multiple layers of shrink wrap and a thick, soft cushion of plastic layers for edge protection. 
\fixme{earlier it says .2 by .2 by 2. Pls reconcile - and maybe we can just say it once? Anne}
Since each sub-module package is so compact, each wooden crate \SI{1.5}{\m} (H) $\times$ \SI{1.3}{\m} (W) $\times$ \SI{2.5}{\m} (D) can transport \num{110} sub-module flat packs stacked in \num{10} (W) $\times$ \num{11} (H) formation.
The total number of sub-module flat packs needed for the entire \dword{fc} is \num{216}, excluding spares, thus all \dword{fc} frame parts can be transported in two boxes. 
Each of these fully loaded crates %would 
will weigh less than \SI{2500}{\kg}.
Since the cage for underground transport at \dword{surf} is 
\SI{3.6}{\m} (H) $\times$ \SI{1.38}{\m} (W) $\times$ \SI{3.7}{\m} (D) with a load capacity of \SI{13000}{lbs}, or approximately \SI{6000}{\kg}, in principle, all \dword{fc} frame parts can be transported underground %in \surf 
in one cage trip. \fixme{reconcile this with logistics - bringing them down together may be irrelevant depending on the cage scheduling. anne}

The extruded aluminum profiles for \dword{fc} are shipped separately in  standard wooden crates. In all, \num{199} profiles of $\sim$\SI{4}{\m} length are needed for each \tpcheight \dword{fc} module, for a total of %. Therefore, 
\num{7164} to transport %profiles must be transported 
underground, excluding spares. The same number of resistive sheaths are %also 
shipped separately in standard wooden crates. % and transported underground. 

The (\SI{12}{\m} (L) $\times$ \SI{30}{\cm} (H) $\times$ \SI{2.5}{\cm} (W)) trusses for the cathode modules  are welded off-site and shipped to \dword{surf} in transport containers. 
The (\SI{12}{\m} (L) $\times$ \SI{2.5}{\cm} (D)) resistive rods are also constructed off-site and shipped in standard wooden boxes. %Given the installation procedure and

the end of the cryostat opposite the \dword{tco}, as are the \dword{fc} super-modules. \fixme{check my edits above. anne} 

The power supply, \fdth{}s, and \dword{hv} extender are sent to \dword{surf} in standard shipping crates. Unwrapping requires clean areas and careful handling. Surfaces can be cleaned with alcohol and allowed to dry.

\subsection{Assembly}
\label{sec:dp-hv-assembly}

%An \dword{fc} sub-module is pre-assembled on a table before packaging to ensure fitness of all parts, including all screws and slip nuts.   When fitness is verified, the sub-module is disassembled and packaged in a \SI{10}{\cm} $\times$ \SI{10}{\cm} $\times$ \SI{2}{\m} compact package with the edges wrapped in a thick plastic layer to protect the parts from mechanical damage from a fall or some similar accident.  This package includes all necessary parts to assemble the given sub-module along with \numrange{10}{20}\% spare parts. This ensures that each package is self-sufficient for final assembly. Each package is given a sub-module number for further tracking. This number stays with the sub-module throughout assembly at \surf and final installation, so the sub-module can be assigned to its specific module and in its proper location within the module. 

%The compact packages of the \dword{dpmod} \dword{fc} parts are shipped to \surf and transported underground for final sub-module assembly prior to the installation. The \SI{4}{\m} long aluminum profiles are produced and shipped to \surf separately for final assembly. The final \dword{qc} of the profiles is conducted during sub-module assembly.   Profiles with deep scratches and sharp protrusions that could cause excess charge concentration will be rejected. This process must be done underground at the time of sub-module assembly because of the delicate nature of the coated surface and the smoothness requirement. %\fixme{I took out: of the smoothness to meet the local maximum field requirement.}

\dword{fc} sub-modules are assembled inside the \dword{dpmod} cryostat. An assembly table with a precision alignment bar for rapid profile alignment is used for this task.  The sub-module package is opened on the table and the mechanical frame is assembled %using 
from two \SI{10.2}{\cm} (\SI{4}{in}) \dword{frp} I-beams and two \SI{2.5}{\cm} (\SI{1}{in}) diameter stainless steel tubes.

Once the frame is assembled, the aluminum profiles are mounted on the flange of the \dword{frp} I-beams and secured using two slip nuts inserted on either end and two button-head, hex-drive metal screws with one side secured tightly and the other loosely but solidly secured to allow motion from thermal contraction.  
The sub-modules designated for the middle %module 
of a super-module must have a square nut inserted  between the two slip nuts for \dword{hvdb} mounting. Care must be taken to avoid scratching %ensure that 
the profiles %are not scratched 
during the mounting process.  

When all screws are hand-tightened as much as possible, the final torque is applied using the \SI{12}{\V} power screwdriver \footnote{Dewalt\texttrademark{} Power Screw Driver} torque set at \num{1}. The final alignment of the profiles is then made by hand, tightening only one or two screws on the tightly secured side as needed. 
A wheel base made of unistrut bars is then mounted to the bottom of the sub-module, and the entire unit is placed in a designated area to await installation. Each sub-module is clearly labeled with its %the designated sub-module 
number for tracking purposes.

Cathode modules will be %assembled on their location 
installed along with their neighboring %as 
\dword{fc} super-modules %are installed 
as described in Section~\ref{sec:fddp-hv-transport-install}.

\subsection{Installation and Integration}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-transport-install}
\fixme{This section may need to go into the DP IIC chapter. Anne}
All \dword{fc} sub-modules are assembled inside the cryostat on an assembly table. Resistive sheaths for sub-module interconnections and the square nuts to hold \dword{hvdb} are pre-inserted to each profile at this stage.
Once a sub-module is fully assembled, a transport wheel base is mounted on it for easy relocation.
When three top sub-modules, three bottom sub-modules, and \num{12} middle modules are assembled, we begin installing them into a super-module, starting at the far end of the cryostat. %, opposite to the temporary construction opening.

The installation sequence for a super-module is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Hang a \SI{12}{\m} stainless steel I-beam from two stainless steel cables through the \fdth{}s and raise it to approximately \SI{2.5}{\m} above the temporary floor.
    \item Place three top sub-modules under the stainless steel I-beam, and connect each to the I-beam using two sets of stainless steel L-brackets, stainless steel inserts, stainless steel screws, stainless steel lock washers, and stainless steel nuts.  
    \item Slide the two resistive sheaths (that are pre-inserted to the middle sub-module) over and tighten them onto the two neighboring profiles to make the resistive connections between profiles in the row. 
    \item Mount \dwords{hvdb} to the center sub-module in the row, using aluminum button-head screws and a square nut pre-inserted in the profile reinforcement rail. This process completes one row of the sub-modules for a super-module, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:dp-super-module-installation-secuence}(a). 
    \item \fixme{start with something like "Mount the...} The three-unit \dword{pds} reflector/\dword{wls} panel assemblies of dimension \SI{199}{\cm} (W) $\times$ \SI{186}{\cm} (H) shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dp-pds-reflector-panel-assembly} for the three middle surfaces in the row and two extended \dword{pds} reflector/\dword{wls} panel assemblies of dimension \SI{290}{\cm} (W) $\times$ \SI{186}{\cm} (H) for the two ends of the row are mounted on the \dword{frp} I-beams of the \dword{fc}, starting from one end of the row and progressing towards the other, covering the entire surface, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:dp-super-module-installation-secuence}(a'). The extended \dword{pds} reflector/\dword{wls} panel assemblies at the end wall corner \dword{fc} submodules will have dimensions \SI{290}{\cm} (W) $\times$ \SI{186}{\cm} (H) whereas the assemblies at the side wall corner \dword{fc} submodules will have dimensions \SI{260}{\cm} (W) $\times$ \SI{186}{\cm} (H).

     The extension of the assemblies to be mounted at corner ends of the side wall \dword{fc} modules is much shorter than the other extended modules \fixme{than the extensions on the other modules?} to safely accommodate the \num{2.4} degree tilt of the end walls.

\section{Design Validation and Verification Plan}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-verification}

Section~\ref{sec:fddp-hv-cathode} \fixme{Section~\ref{sec:fddp-hv-protodune}?} describes the changes to the design relative to %with respect to the 
\dword{pddp}. These changes on the cathode design are made to address the sudden release of the energy stored between the cathode plane and the ground grid. The change mainly consists of replacing the continuous metallic structure employed in \dword{pddp} with a segmented and resistive one. \fixme{already said} 
R\&D is in progress to adapt the solid experience accrued from the Single Phase detector CPA to the DP cathode plane design.

On the \dword{fc} side, the main changes are the removal of all insulating materials facing the cryostat wall, and the assembly and installation procedure which will be based on \SI{12}{\m}$\times$ \SI{12}{\m} supermodels. 
It is planned to test this procedures with mock-up modules in Ash River, which can be carried independently with the planned electrical performance testing in \dword{pddp} II.   \fixme{already said}
The electrical behavior of the cathode and \dword{fc} structure will be studied in a \dword{spice} simulation to  confirm the design intention and identify weaknesses. It will be validated in \dword{pddp} II, with a similar \dword{fc} design tested earlier in \dword{pdsp} II. \fixme{??}

Tests of the \SI{600}{kV} \dword{hvps} %power supply 
and cryogenic \fdth are at the moment planned to be performed in a dedicated cryostat (as for the \SI{300}{kV} one \fixme{the same cryostat?}) whenever the joint R\&D with Heinzinger will would make them available.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Interfaces }
\label{sec:fddp-hv-transport-interfaces}

\fixme{This section covers mechanical interface to the cryostat, including the penetrations}
\fixme{Interfaces Table goes in this section.}


\subsection{Internal cryogenic system}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-intfc-to-cryogenic}

The interface with the cryogenics system involves coordinating the placement of the cryogenic pipes. The locations of the \dword{gg} feet and the \dwords{pmt} must clear the cryogenic pipes and the membrane corrugations on the floor. As of this writing, the nominal position of the vertical gas purging pipe is uncomfortably close to the \dword{fc} wall.


\subsection{Cryostat}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-intfc-to-cryostat}

The cathode and \dword{fc} are suspended under the cryostat roof through special \fdth{}s. The \dword{hv} \fdth requires a port on the cryostat at a specific location.  The locations, size, height, and load-bearing capability of these roof penetrations are being coordinated to allow detailed design of the \dword{hvs}.

%Each \dword{fc} module is suspended and raised by two ropes hung from the cryostat roof through the \dword{fc} suspension \fdth{}s, by winches as in \dword{pddp}.  

%Once an \dword{fc} module of the full height is completed for \dword{dpmod}, it will be hung  from the cables attached to the final suspension hook and the  suspension \fdth is then fully sealed. 

%A possible improvement on the \dword{pddp} interface is to use remote-controlled electrical wrenches (as opposed to manual) to ensure synchronized lifting of the modules.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Charge Readout Plane}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-intfc-to-crp}

The \dword{hv} and \dword{crp} systems are independently suspended and do not physically touch each other.  The relative vertical position between the top \dword{fc} profiles and the \dword{crp} affects the drift field uniformity near the \dword{crp}.  The \dword{crp}  dynamically follows the liquid surface whereas the height of the \dword{hvs} is fixed, so the maximum excursion of the \dword{crp}-liquid level must be controlled to avoid excess drift and extraction field distortion.

The \dword{hv} feedthrough and extender structure goes through a corner of the \dword{crp}.  A special \dword{crp} module must be constructed to allow the \dword{hv} feedthrough to be installed.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Photon Detection System}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-intfc-to-pds}

%No direct hardware interface exists between the \dword{hv} and \dword{pd} systems. The cryostat penetrations and \fdth{}s for the two systems are completely independent, as are their control electronics. The only interfaces envisaged are effectively at the level of design requirements and include 

The cryostat penetrations and \fdth{}s for these two systems are completely independent, as are their control electronics. The interfaces envisaged are effectively at the level of design requirements and installation coordination, and include

\begin{itemize}
    \item maintaining a safe minimum distance between the \dwords{pd} and the \dptargetdriftvoltneg cathode;
    \item defining a mutually agreed upon optical transparency of the cathode + ground grid combination.  In general, a more open cathode and ground grid will have a higher \efield;
    \item  defining the \dword{pd} power dissipation limit (production of bubbles would compromise \dword{hv} stability). The power dissipation depends on the final \dword{pd} density chosen, which is awaiting simulation results;
    %\item if the \dword{pds} wants to install reflector foils on the \dword{fc}, \dword{hvs} is to design a specific mounting feature for the reflector foils;
    \item agreement on the design of the reflector/\dword{wls} panel assemblies to be mounted on the inner walls of the \dword{fc} and an efficient installation plan;
    \item installing individual \dwords{gg} on the \dword{pmt} supports is under discussion with the \dword{pds} consortium.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Slow Control}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-intfc-to-cisc}

The \dword{hvs} relies on \dword{cisc} to control the \dword{hvps} and monitor the return currents from the \dword{fc} power return circuits.  An interlock of the \dword{hv} power supply with the liquid level should be implemented to prevent \dword{hv} discharge in gaseous argon.  A controlled shutdown of the \dword{hv} power supply with the opening of the cryostat pressure relief valve must also be implemented.

\subsection{Technical Coordination}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-intfc-to-tc}

The shipping, storage, underground transportation, assembly, and installation of all \dword{hvs} components are coordinated with Technical Coordination.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Appendix - Alternatives}

%\subsection{Optical Reflectors on \dword{fc} FRP Frames}

%The \dual \dword{pds} has expressed interest in adding \dword{wls} coated reflector foils on the \dword{fc} inner surfaces to increase light collection efficiency for the upper portion of the \dword{tpc}.  

%The reflector foils on their own are very thin and fragile, with different CTE than the rest of the \dword{fc} structure. Unsupported large sheets, therefore, should not be mounted directly onto the \dword{fc}.  However, laminating the reflector foil over a G10/FR4 sheet creates a panel that could be easily attached over the \dword{fc} FRP I-beams.  Since the G10 sheet has a lower CTE than the stainless steel \dword{fc} cross bars, some sliding motion on the mounting fixture is envisioned.

%If the area coverage required is less than \num{50}~\%, the reflector foils may be cut into strips and  installed onto each of the \dword{fc} profiles without interfering with the liquid flow.

%The effect of the reflector panels, if their coverage area is large, on the \dword{lar} flow pattern and the force exerted on the panels must be studied before this option is chosen.

\subsection{Calibration Laser Penetrations}

%Despite being in an underground environment, the \dual detector should have non-neglegible space charge distortion due to the ion feedback from the multiplication of $^{39}$Ar ionizations through the \dwords{lem}. The liquid argon convective flow will make the space charge density distribution difficult to model accurately. Therefore, using UV laser beams is highly desirable to calibrate the charge signal based on the measured field distortions throughout the \dword{tpc} volume.
Despite its underground environment, the \dword{dpmod} is likely to have non-neglegible space charge distortion due to the ion feedback from the multiplication of $^{39}$Ar ionizations through the \dwords{lem}. The \dword{lar} convective flow will make the space charge density distribution difficult to model accurately. Therefore, using UV laser beams is highly desirable to calibrate the charge signal based on the measured field distortions throughout the \dword{tpc} volume.

We have designed a \SI{15}{\cm} offset between the \dword{fc} and the edges of the \dword{crp}, so we may be able to place laser heads through this gap to scan the \dword{tpc} active volume. Obviously, the stainless steel \dword{fc} support I-beam is in the way, but it should be fairly straightforward to make openings through the I-beam 
%\fixme{Which I-beam is this, the stainless steel I-beam the FC hangs from? if the reflective foils are to be now in the base design the interference with the laser should also be meintioned.}
to allow a $\sim\,$\SI{10}{\cm} \dword{od} object through. This feature will be designed and developed if the calibration consortium decides to implement a laser system.  Naturally, the penetrations for the lasers would need to be planned in the cryostat design. % if such a system is likely.

\subsection{Individual Ground Grids on PDS PMTs}

 Installing an individual \dword{gg} for each \dword{pmt}, in place of the ground grid table structure, is under consideration in collaboration with the \dword{pd} consortium. Since the individual \dword{gg} cages would potentially have thinner wires and be closer to the \dword{pmt} windows, thus generating  smaller shadows, they are expected to increase the light transparency to the \dwords{pmt}.

The  \dword{hv} consortium will study the  operational feasibility of the design % in terms of operation in the \dune \dual 
under \dword{dpmod} conditions.  Engineering teams from both consortia will jointly develop the design of the individual grids, the %production of the grids will be done by 
\dword{hv} consortium would produce them, and the \dword{pd} consortium would install them  %The grids will be installed %at the \dword{itf} Anne removed

\subsection{HV Consortium Organization}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-org-consortium}

The \dword{hvs} consortium includes %has consolidated 
all the institutions participating in the design, construction, and assembly of the \dword{hv} systems for both \dword{pdsp}  and \dword{pddp}. 
%The consortium 
It currently comprises several USA institutions and \dword{cern}, %presently 
the only non-USA participant. As it has been for \dword{protodune}, \dword{cern} is %heavily
strongly committed to a significant role in terms of funding, personnel, 
 and providing infrastructure for R\&D and detector optimization. Moreover, \dword{cern} will be responsible for a significant fraction of subsystem deliverables; as such,  \dword{cern} is actively in search of additional European institutions to join the consortium. 
 
 In the current \dword{hv} consortium organization, each institution naturally assumes the same responsibilities that it assumed for \dword{pdsp} and \dword{pddp}.

The consortium organizational structure includes a scientific lead from \dword{cern}, a technical lead from BNL and, or as for the \dword{pddp}, a \dword{tdr} editor from the University of Texas at Arlington.  \dword{hvs} design and integration is presently lead by \dword{cern}. 
The consortium is organized into working groups addressing the design and  R\&D issues, as well as producing and installing the hardware.

At present, the \dword{hv} consortium is gathering institutions to participate in the design, construction, and assembly of the \dword{hv} systems for both \dwords{spmod} and \dwords{dpmod}. 
The consortium is likely to expand in the near future. Discussions are underway with institutions, in particular from the EU, to balance USA participation with additional international partners.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Planning Assumptions}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-org-assmp}

The present baseline design for all elements of the \dword{hv} system for the \dword{dpmod} follows the experience with \dword{pddp} as well as the \dword{pdsp} designs, including production and assembly.  

It is %also 
assumed that no major issues in the \dword{hv} system operation of \dword{pddp} will be encountered, and therefore the basic \dword{hv} system concepts are sound.

However some design modifications and optimizations have been implemented to take into account the %twice-as-long 
doubled drift distance, requiring an increase in \dword{hv} delivered to the cathode from \SI{-300}{\kV} to \dptargetdriftvoltneg{} and the much higher energy stored in the cryostat as a result, %because of the applied \dword{hv}, 
and the increased detector volume compared to \dword{pddp}.

Therefore the \dword{dp} \dword{hv} system distribution and the related cathode structure still require intense R\&D, given the unprecedented value of the required \dword{hv} (\dptargetdriftvoltneg) and the surface area covered by the cathode plane compared to \dword{pddp}. 
The related results could lead to revising design details such as the shape of the cathode elements and of the %\dword{gg} 
\dword{gp} structures, the distance from the cryostat walls, the distance between the cathode and the %\dword{gg} 
\dword{gp} protecting t?he \dwords{pd}, and resistive connections of the cathode modules. We must ensure that the \efield strength in the \dword{lar} is below the critical value of  about \SI{30}{\kV/\cm} everywhere and that the energy stored in the \dword{fc} is not released catastrophically to the cryostat membrane. 

%As in the \dword{spmod}, 
\dword{pddp} will be the testing ground where we come to understand and optimize detector element assembly, installation sequence, and integration, as well as requirements in human resources, space and tooling, and schedule.

\fixme{Table~\ref{tab:dp-hv-sched} is a standard table template for the TDR schedules.  It contains overall FD dates from Eric James as of March 2019 (orange) that are held in macros in the common/defs.tex file so that the TDR team can change them if needed. Please do not edit these lines! Please add your milestone dates to fit in with the overall FD schedule.  Anne}

A first high-level summary of the cost estimate for the \dword{hv} system of one \dword{dpmod} was obtained by extrapolating from the as-realized \dword{pddp} costs and effort, except for the cathode that was introduced as a new concept and whose estimation is more uncertain. Moreover, these estimates do not include any projected cost savings that would be realized by producing many units at each production site. %Given the small numbers of each unit required for the \dword{pddp} the assembly sites were still climbing the learning curve; this could give substantial savings. 
Substantial savings from higher-volume production is still possible, however. For \dword{pddp} the assembly sites produced only small numbers of each unit, and thus remained on the learning curve.
