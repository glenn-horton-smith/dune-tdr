\chapter{Photon Detection System}
\label{ch:dp-pds}

The \dword{pds} of the \dune \dual module uses large-area cryogenic \dwords{pmt} coated with \dword{tpb} to detect the \SI{127}{\nm} light produced by argon scintillation. The \dwords{pmt} are installed on the cryostat floor, underneath the \dshort{tpc} transparent cathode, and view the entire \lar volume of one \dword{fd} module. The design described in this chapter builds on experience from several \lartpc{}s, and particularly from the \dword{wa105} and from the \dword{pddp} detectors at \dshort{cern}. 

The chapter is organised as follows. Sec.~\ref{sec:dp-pds-requirements} introduces the physics requirements to be met by the \dword{pds}, and additional opportunities offered by the system. Sec.~\ref{sec:dp-pds-overview} gives gives an overview of the \dword{pds} baseline design, together with the detector specifications to be satisfied. Secs.~\ref{sec:dp-pds-photosensors}--\ref{sec:dp-pds-calibration} describe in detail the \dword{pds} baseline design, and particularly the \dword{pds} photosensor system (Sec.~\ref{sec:dp-pds-photosensors}), the mechanical aspects (Sec.~\ref{sec:dp-pds-mechanics}),  the readout electronics (Sec.~\ref{sec:dp-pds-electronics}) and the calibration system (Sec.~\ref{sec:dp-pds-calibration}). Secs.~\ref{sec:dp-pds-simulation}--\ref{sec:dp-pds-performance} demonstrate how the PDS baseline design has been validated using detailed simulations (Sec.~\ref{sec:dp-pds-simulation} and \ref{sec:dp-pds-performance}) and experience from prototypes (Sec.~\ref{sec:dp-pds-prototypes}). Secs.~10-15 cover PDS project aspects, namely: quality control (Sec.~10), interfaces (Sec.~11), installation (Sec.~12), risks (Sec.~13), safety (Sec.~14), and high-level schedule and cost (Sec.~15). Finally, Sec.~16 discusses a limited number of alternatives to this baseline design.
