\subsection{Consortium Organization}
\label{ssec:dp-tpcelec-org-consortium}
The \dual TPC electronics consortium consists of seven participating institutions from France (\num{3}), Japan (\num{3}), and the USA (\num{1}). The consortium leader is from IPNL, France, and the technical leader is from KEK, Japan. The consortium includes members from APC, IPNL, and LAPP in France; Iwate University, KEK, and NITKC in Japan; and SMU in the USA.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Planning Assumptions}
\label{ssec:dp-tpcelec-org-assmp}
The design of the \dual TPC electronics system relies on the elements that have already been developed for \dword{pddp} and tested in the \dword{wa105}.  Commissioning of the \dword{pddp} in 2019 should provide some additional information, but is not expected to alter the design of principal components. A potential improvements related to the increase in the channel density supported by \dwords{amc}  is possible for the purpose of further cost reduction. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{WBS and Responsibilities}
\label{ssec:dp-tpcelec-org-wbs}
The description of the \dword{wbs} including the assignments of the responsible institutions is documented in \citedocdb{5594}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{High-level Cost and Schedule}
\label{ssec:dp-tpcelec-org-cs}
The key schedule milestones are listed in Table~\ref{tab:dp-tpcelec-milestones}. The given dates assume the installation of the \dual TPC as the second \dword{fd} \dword{detmodule}.

The detailed cost model for the \dual TPC electronics system has been developed based on the scaling of the costs for the electronics system of \dword{pddp}. The core costs for the production of the electronics system to instrument a single \dword{dpmod} are summarized Table~\ref{tab:dp-tpcelec-costs}.
