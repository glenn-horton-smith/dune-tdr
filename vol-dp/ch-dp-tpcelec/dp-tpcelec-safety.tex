The installation and operation of the electronics system does not pose any particular or abnormal safety risks. The handling of the equipment during the installation underground should follow the safety protocols established by \dword{uit}. 

In the operation stage the low voltage power supplies for \dword{fe} cards and \dword{utca} crates are powered from the standard mains system. They do not required any additional protection beyond the one provided by the power distribution system underground. 

The \dwords{sftchimney} are cooled with liquid argon. In the event of leak cooling circuit each \dword{sftchimney} is protected with the over-pressure release valve that will vent the excess gas from its inner volume.
