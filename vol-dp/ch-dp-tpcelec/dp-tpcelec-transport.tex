The \dwords{sftchimney} are \SI{2350}{\mm} long and weigh \SI{180}{\kg}.  The cold and warm flanges are mounted at the assembly site, and the chimneys undergo leak-testing before they are shipped in wooden crates (approximate dimensions \SI[product-units=power]{2.5x0.5x0.5}{m}) to \dword{surf}. Once at \dword{surf}, the crates are moved underground and placed on the roof of the cryostat by the \dword{uit}. The \dual electronics consortium is then responsible for unpacking the crates and installing the \dwords{sftchimney}. 

The boxes containing the electronic cards and \dword{utca} crates are also handled by \dual electronics consortium personnel. These should be lightweight and easy to carry. A box containing \num{100} \dword{amc} cards has a maximum dimension of \SI{60}{\cm} and weighs less than \SI{10}{\kg}.
