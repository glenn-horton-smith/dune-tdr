\section{Project Management}
\label{sec:dp-pds-management}

The \dual \dword{pd} consortium was formed in 2017;  it comprises eleven institutions from France, Peru, Spain, UK, and USA. The charge of the \dual \dword{pd} consortium is to plan and execute the construction, installation, and commissioning of the \dual \dword{pds}.
% I think we should check with Peru and UK if they are still interested in being included in the consortium

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Consortium Organization}

The current \dual \dword{pd} consortium leader is %In\'{e}s Gil-Botella
 from CIEMAT (Spain) and the technical lead is %Dominique Duchesneau 
 from LAPP (France). They are members of the \dword{dune} technical board and represent the consortium in the overall \dword{dune} collaboration. The consortium leader is responsible for the subsystem deliverables and for effectively managing the consortium. The technical lead acts as the overall project manager and is the interface to the international project office; he is responsible for monitoring and reporting on progress on the agreed schedule and for interface documentation.

The institutions participating in the consortium are responsible for the design and/or construction of a particular subsystem. The national groups within the consortium plan to approach relevant funding agencies with a specific construction-phase proposal to obtain a likely funding line in 2019. The \dual \dword{pd} consortium is open to any new institution willing to join the current effort.

The current institutions participating in the \dual \dword{pd} consortium are LAPP (France); PUCP (Peru); IFAE, CIEMAT, and IFIC (Spain); UCL (UK); and ANL, Duke U., U. of Iowa, SDSMT, and UTA (USA).

The \dual \dword{pd} consortium is divided into four working groups: photosensors and electronics; calibration system; mechanics and integration; and simulation and physics. The corresponding current Working Group convener institutions are
\begin{itemize}
% AH REMOVING NAMES
\item WG1: Photosensors and Electronics -  CIEMAT, %A. Verdugo
\item WG2: Calibration System -  CIEMAT, %C. Cuesta
\item WG3: Mechanics and Integration - University of Iowa%, and %B. Bilki 
\item WG4: Simulation and Physics - %K. Scholberg (
Duke University, %M. Sorel (
IFIC, %L. Zambelli (
LAPP.
\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Planning Assumptions}
%\label{sec:fddp-pd-12.2}

%The optimization and final design of the \dual \dword{pd} system will be driven by the \dword{pddp} data, expected by Summer 2019.

%\dword{pddp} operation and data analysis are fundamental steps to understanding whether the current \dword{pds} design considered as baseline, based on cryogenic \dwords{pmt} with \dword{tpb} coating, is able to provide $t_0$ for non-beam events, background rejection and triggering on non-beam events. These data will be used to tune the \dword{mc} simulations and extrapolate the performance of the system to the \dword{dpmod}.


\subsection{Planning Assumptions}
\label{sec:fddp-pd-12.2}

The baseline design of the \dual \dword{pds} is a complex optimization based on the results from and experience with the first tonne scale dual phase \dword{lar} \dword{tpc} demonstrator (\dword{wa105}), critical evaluation of the design and construction of \dword{wa105} and \dword{pddp}, physics objectives of the \dune experiment, and the detailed simulation studies of \dune \dword{dp} as well as \dword{wa105} and \dword{pddp}.

The previous design and construction of the \dual modules have enabled us to critically evaluate several scenarios and develop the \dune \dword{pds} design optimized for maximum physics performance; simple construction, transportation, handling, and installation; and easy and robust operation.

Simulations are effectively used in designing and optimizing the \dual \dword{pd} system to meet the physics requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item light collection efficiency,
\item number of channels,
\item photosensor requirements,
\item dynamic range of readout electronics and timing resolution, and 
\item trigger strategy on non-beam events.
\end{itemize}

Although no major design modifications are foreseen, the \dword{pddp} operations will be closely monitored to fine-tune the \dune \dual design.

It contains overall FD dates from Eric James as of March 2019 (orange) that are held in macros in the common/defs.tex file so that the TDR team can change them if needed.
