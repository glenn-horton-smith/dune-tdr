\section{Quality Control and Quality Assurance}
\label{sec:dp-pds-quality}

The \dword{qa} and \dword{qc} procedures for the \dual \dword{pds} are based on our experience with the \dword{pddp}. The \dwords{pmt} of the \dual \dword{pds} will go through a series of performance and functionality tests at various locations until commissioning. The mechanical assembly of the \dwords{pmt} will go through mechanical tests, the high voltage cables will be tested for continuity and resistance, the high voltage/signal splitters will be tested for electronics integrity, and the calibration fibers will be tested for high quality transmission. Below  are the details of the quality assurance and control procedures.

\subsection{Quality Control During Production and Assembly}

The \dword{qc} performed at the different institutions, after receiving the \dwords{pmt} from the manufacturer, include \dword{qc} testing before accepting or returning the \dwords{pmt} using established acceptance and rejection criteria. \dword{qc} also includes checking the construction of the base boards, support structures, cables, \dword{hv}/signal splitters, and light calibration units. \dword{qc} also includes mechanical tests of the assembly and performance tests of the \dwords{pmt} and electronics, both at room temperature and when necessary, at cryogenic temperatures. The institutes that perform these tests are referred to as production and assembly sites.

\begin{itemize}
\item The \dwords{pmt} will be visually inspected as they are received from the manufacturer.

\item 
%The baseboards will be tested for electronics integrity as they are produced, before they are connected to the \dwords{pmt}. Once they are connected, mechanical integrity will be tested. 
The \dword{pmt} support structure design is already validated by immersing its mounted \dword{pmt} in cryogenic temperatures and at an over-pressure equivalent to a depth of \SI{12}{m} in \lar{}. Design validation tests are carried out to confirm that the \dword{pmt} base design fulfills the specifications at room and cryogenic temperatures. A cable with a \dword{shv} connector is soldered to each \dword{pmt} base to facilitate the different base and \dword{pmt} tests and the final \dword{pmt} connection during the installation. The \dword{pmt} bases are labeled (on the cable) to track them. After production of the \dword{pmt} base boards, each is individually tested before connecting to the \dwords{pmt} to verify that components are correctly mounted. Later they are cleaned and tested at maximum voltage in an argon gas environment to confirm that no sparks occur. After mounting the bases on the \dwords{pmt}, they are tested again %in argon gas 
at maximum voltage to confirm that no sparks occur due to poor soldering.

\item All the light readout units (\dword{pmt} + base + support) will be tested and characterized in liquid nitrogen to check performance at cryogenic temperature and to obtain a database with the most important parameters for each \dword{pmt} (for example, gain versus voltage, dark counts). The \dword{pmt} base number attached to each \dword{pmt} will also be included in the database.

\item The wrapping materials and techniques are studied with one fully assembled light readout unit. The handling, transportation, and installation scenarios are carefully studied, and the transportation box design is validated. The transport box and \dword{pmt} wrapping must ensure complete darkness.

\item The light output of the \dwords{led} and fiber light transmission from the light calibration system will be measured with a power meter.

\item The high voltage cables will be tested for continuity and for resistance.

\item The high voltage/signal splitters will be tested for electronics integrity followed by  performance tests with a reference \dword{pmt}.

\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Quality Control at the Integration and Testing Facility}
\subsection{Quality Control at the Coating, Testing and Storage Facility}

The \dwords{pmt} will be transported to the \dword{ctsf}, envisaged to be established %in South Dakota 
near the experiment site. As the \dword{pmt} boxes are received, they will be visually inspected to verify they were safely transported. The \dword{tpb} coating of the \dword{pmt} windows will be performed at the \dword{ctsf}. The \dword{pmt} windows will be cleaned before the coating is applied. The \dword{qc} of the cleaning will be qualitative based on experience. The \dwords{pmt} will then be placed in the evaporator, and the coating will be applied. The first few samples will undergo microscopic examination and surface uniformity tests, and the coating procedure will be validated. Subsequent production \dwords{pmt} will be randomly sampled for basic coating \dword{qa}.

Once the coating is finished, the \dwords{pmt} will be packed in special underground transport assembly and placed inside the original transportation boxes. The \dwords{pmt}, however, will not be placed in the cartons. They will have protective covers over the windows. Before being placed in the transportation assembly, the \dwords{pmt} will undergo functionality tests individually. Once all the \dwords{pmt} in a box are validated, the box will be closed and transported to the underground hall.

The \dword{ctsf} is also the primary reception point for the other \dword{dp} \dword{pds} equipment, including cables, fibers, light calibration systems, and \dword{hv}/signal splitters. These boxes will be inspected for verify they were safely transported. Unless signs of  damage to the transportation boxes are obvious, no \dword{qc} inspection will be performed on the individual items. If  damage is identified, the boxes will be opened and visual/functional \dword{qc} tests will be performed. If damaged items can be repaired, that will be done at the \dword{ctsf}. If the damage is not repairable, the items will be returned to the manufacturer or the production/assembly sites.

\subsection{Quality Control at the Underground Areas}

After  transportation from the \dword{ctsf} to \surf, the \dwords{pmt} will be tested for proper functionality in a dedicated light-tight box in the clean room. During installation, the \dword{pmt} database will be updated with the position of each \dword{pmt} (identified by its serial number and base number) in the \dword{detmodule}. After installation, the full connection from the \dword{fe} to the \dwords{pmt} will be checked. The \dword{fe} channel and splitter number connected to each \dword{pmt} will be included in the \dword{pmt} database.

The \dword{hv}/signal cables and the calibration fibers will be transported to the cryostat roof long before the \dwords{pmt} themselves. As they arrive, they will be checked for potential damage during transportation. These tests will include continuity tests for the \dword{hv}/signal cables and qualitative transmission tests for the calibration fibers.

The last step of \dword{qc} will be to test the entire system using the full readout chain (Section~\ref{subsec:dp-pds-commissioning}).
